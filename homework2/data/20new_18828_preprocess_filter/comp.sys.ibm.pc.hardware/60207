darryl subject problem adaptec scsi jumbo tape drive ron wrote ive replaced existing scsi controller adaptec trouble jumbo 250 tape drive document wrote time back slightly 6 ha released much still useful darryl internet disclaimer thi message author personal opinion constitute support opinion policy hewlettpackard little green man following day id 18 hint tip adaptec scsi adapter thi document contain hint tip getting adaptec scsi adapter work variou hardware software package based upon experience adaptec controller hopefully help however note guarantee following really help work information thi document could possibly cause lose ymy file ymy hard disk important back entire content ymy hard disk trying anything based upon information thi document copyright 1993 darryl thi document may freely copied personal use may publication without consent author please note connection adaptec customer topic covered thi document window 31 enhanced mode tape backup device sound card miscellaneou info please note part thi document contain technical sometime description problem reference adaptec technical support 800 adaptec bb 408 please send comment correction etc vium email compuserve internet window 31 enhanced mode window 31 install program automatically configure window use adaptec 1542 however case something went wrong im going describe change needed get window 31 working 1542 also may noticed installing window 31 make ymy pc run much slower even youre running window method speeding discussed section called window 31 run slowly msdo configuration window install program add smartdrive disk cache ymy configsy autoexecbat file follow instruction youll notice youll need use smartdrive thi default setup youll also notice ymy system run much much slower window msdo see section called window 31 run slowly way speeding ymy system window configuration get adaptec 1542 work window make sure section systemini file contain entry believe window install program automatically add thi entry systemini im sure thi doesnt work might want try adding line probably dont need line though entry used enable support memory manager like needed use program window 31 run slowly get window 31 running 1542 chance ymy system running much slower probably 1 happen using version 31 ymy configsy file thi appear winning solution 2 lucky whether ymy luck hold remain seen ymy system running much slower thi almost definitely caused smartdrive according window documentation microsoft technical note smartdrive double required must use smartdrive enabled thi work really slow ymy pc estimated thi slowed pc factor 5 five consider thi unacceptable looked solution unfortunately disable window 31 enhanced mode work might even destroy content ymy hard disk trying run window 31 one following 1 use driver provide opinion unbelievable smartdrive caused either bug smartdrive 2 use driver provide vd service vd stand virtual dma service thi standard supported window 31 allows disk controller like 1542 work window hard disk time found following solution none require using smartdrive note however getting occasional parity error probably caused solution might see following require smartdrive using kind disk cache utility strongly recommended thi make window run much much faster 1 driver need function controlling cdrom tape drive two physical hard disk etc add driver ymy configsy file eg window need option thi driver must loaded low memory loaded high memory november 1992 driver could obtained adaptec bb hopefully still 2 need function driver version 30 use driver ymy configsy file eg enough driver also loaded high assuming 50 would thought thi would crash system doesnt asked adaptec technical support thi said loading high fine long loaded low system using would occasionally cause window 31 crash upon window additional result corrupted disk file would corrupted crash usually occurred making different program default window shell thi reason may necessary absolutely idea necessary version earlier 30 note many person use 30 without seem problem consider person lucky like sort problem 3 opinion best necessarily easiest solution upgrade 31 driver longer needed unfortunately could get previou upgrade adaptec bb 31 driver available adaptec bb far know three way get copy buy new november 1992 adaptec scsi driver kit supposedly include 31 well driver cdrom driver believe list price around 75 already copy older version supposedly contact adaptec upgrade scsi around 30 copy 31 included central point pc tool 80 msdo note documentation driver stored different directory note included cdrom driver driver support two hard disk included thi obtained copy 31 note however getting occasional parity error window probability defective hardware pc causing thi upgraded motherboard found solution however parity error occur disk small definite possibility parity error example changing bu timing certain disk transfer might cause thi ive run variou memory test hour time test found problem thi problem probably caused memory marginal timing requirement cause parity error disk transfer thi memory test didnt find problem problem show disk io however im mentioning thi case isnt hardware problem tape backup device two possible problem using adaptec 1542 tape backup device colorado memory system jumbo 250 1 tape take long time tape drive constantly start stop start stop etc 2 tape operation may encounter many tape error thi problem might caused defective hardware 1542 however ive heard person similar problem im mentioning thi case hardware problem 1542 tape take long time tape backup device may adjust adaptec bu timing best result using tape drive normally tape backup restore tape drive motor continuously running occasional pause however default bu timing adaptec may cause tape drive motor start stop start stop every second thi cause needle wear tape tape drive however note dirty tape head defective tape drive also cause thi make sure ymy tape head clean thi also cause tape backup restore take much much longer necessary problem tape backup use floppy dma transfer datum memory tofrom tape drive adaptec use dma transfer datum memory tofrom hard disk floppy dma need feed datum tape drive certain rate tape drive fed datum quickly enough floppy dma tape drive stop bit restart enough datum eventually fed default bu timing adaptec really dma timing large example backup done datum ha transferred hard disk memory memory tape default timing adaptec hog memory much much time spent transferring datum hard disk memory enough time spent transferring datum memory tape drive result tape drive constantly start stop datum fed quickly enough solution change adaptec bu timing default factory setting 11 5 bu timing need 24 thi done one two way use n option example use bu timing 4 mean use following line configsy file note space n 4 dont ymy try find program called difficult find reason adaptec reason seem want thi widely distributed asked someone worked adaptec asked upload anywhere anonymou ftp acces internet could try using archie hunt copy believe couple site find copy run like thi adjust bu timing 4 running without argument reset bu timing back factory default note seem use use crashed system wa loaded could use however lower bu timing 2 increase 11 lower low hard disk throughput suddenly drop ymy system feel slower 4 work fine thi value may work fine may adjust little youve bu timing tape backup restore run faster also experiment bu time option intentionally described unles know bad combination cause parity error worse memory refresh program called exist adaptec bb unles thi ha upgraded since last checked ha thi archive containing batch file couple file thi batch file wa supposed allow one set bu time however tried running thi program system crashed time wa running didnt check see wa conflict maybe thi old program work although doc say work tape operation many tape error thi problem may may exist although existed system hardware problem particular 1542 could cause however ive heard person similar problem im mentioning thi case isnt hardware problem 1542 symptom thi problem even cleaning tape head 1 backing tape encounter sector detected error resulting tape backup 2 tape backup work tape compare fail 3 tape drive start stop start stop etc much often unlike problem tape take long time tape drive start stop every second thi kind occur every 1020 second 4 plu 31 tape backup device program like central point backup cm jumbo software assuming cm jumbo 250 tape drive tape drive plu 31 5 many tape read error although know causing thi problem discovered using different floppy controller month ago upgraded motherboard contained integrated floppy controller already floppy controller 1542 initially disabled motherboard floppy controller decided try 1542 floppy controller using one motherboard thi tape drive cm jumbo 250 reliability increased dramatically plu 31 wa suddenly able find use tape drive dont know thi wa caused hardware problem 1542 one hand floppy drife worked great attached 1542 seem say wa nothing wrong 1542 hand tape drive didnt work well attached 1542 floppy controller work attached different controller thi could indication hardware problem 1542 change floppy drive cable conceivable problem wa cable dont know cause really however youre similar problem might want consider trying new floppy controller sound card many popular sound card play record digitized sound thi typically done using dma like tape drive dma adaptec dma conflict sound card dma unlike tape dma thi conflict usually manifest parity error ymy system crash parity error message happen datum transferred quickly sound card adaptec memory refresh occur quickly enough cause parity error usually getting parity error mean hardware problem ymy system thi case however parity error symptom bad hardware ive found parity error typically occur recording digitized sound chance error increase increase recording eg higher sampling rate recording stereo recording using 16bit instead 8 etc like tape drive solution solution lower adaptec bu timing see section tape drife information thi done note however thi may may solve problem may reduce probability parity error software used record digitized sound greatly affect thi problem ie software disk speed ymy hard disk amount disk also affect thi miscellaneou info thi section contain miscellaneou hint tip rumor much merely information ive heard read verified believe following information correct im sure use ymy risk qemm 600 602 need specify db parameter eg unles using driver dont qemm although qemm manual mention thi install program seem detect 1542 present automatically add thi option qemm command line least thi occurred qemm 600 install program havent tested version earlier version qemm probably need thi parameter im sure ive never used version earlier 600 use need give qemm db parameter version 1542 support hard disk one size support hard disk capacity need get new rom bio adaptec im sure thi still true latest sold adaptec connect cdrom drive 1542 need scsi cdrom drive driver note cdrom drife proprietary interface drife used 1542 three choice cdrom driver idea well following solution work even work following information 1 buy adaptec scsi driver package list something like 75 already older adaptec driver supposedly upgrade scsi around 30 contact adaptec detail scsi package supposedly contain everything need 2 buy driver package made person make coreldraw thi package contain cdrom driver scsi tape driver worm driver etc know list price ive seen thi package sold around note come driver needed already may better getting adaptec scsi instead 3 thi method obsolete following driver adaptec scsi kit im mentioning case someone already ha driver use driver adaptec kit kit cdrom driver get copy cdrom driver included kit thi available several bulletin board use scsi tape drive 1542 need software know talk scsi tape drive software ive heard like section cdrom drife idea well following solution work even work following information 1 central point pc tool 80 msdo supposedly support large number scsi tape drife come scsi driver 31 well central point backup 2 driver package contain scsi tape backup program see section cdrom drife detail however note come require ive seen advertisement sell 1542 three configuration 1 1542 scsi controller hard disk rom bio 2 1542 scsi controller adaptec driver 3 1542 scsi controller adaptec driver imagine adaptec sell 1542 fourth configuration 4 1542 scsi controller scsi driver including driver person use unix might interested version gnu tar msdo talk scsi tape drive vium driver need thi driver use thi program ive never used thi version gnu tar ive heard work dont know well though anonymou ftp acces internet copy found mirror site gnu tar scsi tape drife adaptec patch relative gnu tar 110 gnu tar scsi tape adaptec idea copy found compuserve might forum far msdo concerned controller msdo work well however hardware two board 100 identical least one program initially work work 386 version unix case anyone curiou edited copy configsy file ram rom shell p note im using qemm 31 using 30 id probably use configsy looked like ram rom shell p werent using id probably use something looked like ram rom shell p however used tape drive planned record sound sound card would still need way changing adaptec bu time first two version configsy take care thi thi last version doesnt local variable 72 end
