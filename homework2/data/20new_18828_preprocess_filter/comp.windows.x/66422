certainly noticeable 680x0 vax platform problem gcc cc use incompatible method passing structure argument returning function value part x linked function pa return runtime error occur affected program include rgb server thi gcc manual sparc gnu cc use incompatible calling convention structure pas including content argument list wherea standard compiler pas effectively reference thi really ought fixed calling convention yet supported gnu cc isnt straightforward fix convention structure returning also incompatible help duck problem either using cc throughout using routine cause problem solved compilation flag file need compiled using cc include addition several function use arg return value call possibly dont involve collected subject 98 io error running x built gcc try run xsun server get error getting interface configuration operation supported socket fatal server bug screen found running gcc script apparently didnt work thi simple test include run cc e gcc e last line output piece interest identical irrelevant difference like gcc version ha x cc version ha ymy run didnt work reason go back ymy gcc source run rebuild x distribution identical try running make clean make sure everything get compiled proper include file courtesy der mouse subject 99 problem compiling x11r4 older found missing define r4 list distributed x11r4 mention add line file older suno version eg 35

building shared library sun remember need run root installing shared library youve installed x run server client building installing distribution need careful avoid existing x shared library might eg distributed openwindow make sure set ymy environment build installation going keep xterm program please note shared library must installed program work else program must linked courtesy mit x

allows window like sample server extension shape extension run server support server well many server support shape extension case display window anyway order use shape extension must link library x11r4 distribution thi library associated include directory file many freeware program use shape extension also compiled without removing define makefile probably thi compile successfully ymy older x library john b subject 110 problem found sun run x program wrote suno 403 41 machine get error symbol found seeing r4 get sun shared library working apparently cant share function called compared thi wa handled putting file function alway used thereby would loaded routine would normally called probably seeing thi error ymy program normal program call anywhere 1 may program use xt function never open connection x server osfmotif 110 thi problem called xt function solution add call ymy program function executed linked 2 alternatively ymy program doesnt need xt function correct calling may xlib xview program thi case remove ymy link command necessary link shared library although thi certainly solve problem jordan haye danny subject 111 cant compile r3 xaw contrib program new x program worked well try link current version x get thi message undefined several name change athena widget set addition header file moving mentioned r4 release note thi case function really xt function part xaw text widget xt xaw subject 112 topic programming problem puzzle subject 113 doesnt program get select sic window manager control input focu transferred one window another order get ymy program must ask window manager input focu thi must set called hint window manager ymy application use something like following true window ymy application based xt intrinsic set resource true probably want case dont source start application resource certain window manager olwm thi done using sun openwindow olwm also add thi resource ymy default file use client arent true mostly courtesy dave ncd stuart mark sun subject 114 figure window manager running cant reliably tell whatever mechanism could use could case case shouldnt care window manager running long thing manner case particular window manager known thing wrong checking particular hint placed window window manager problem may appropriate case alternatively may appropriate determine window manager running order take advantage specific added feature olwm menu order give ymy program added functionality beware window manager function providing functionality even missing thi surely lead future compatibility problem subject 115 x program available general framework program macintosh handle lot odd end overhead development window system used platform additional development x problem typically solved using interactive application builder tool using existing x application good application might look manipulate want test thi one little thing include simple r4 program put window allows offer starting point quick hack xaw example example directory r3 r4 distribution xlib hello world example r3 r4 updated version thi program use r4 xlib call current convention wa posted compwindowsx glenn tektronix addition sample xt program xaw rainer showing open multiple display catch broken display connection available exportlcsmitedu subject 116 work sic interface resource widget sensitive type variable ymy code may something like thi arg int int sensitive oop wrong datum type sensitive arg machine single byte variable sensitive work properly thi problem come often using particular toolkit xt type dimension position code assume int similar problem type actually short general safe use actual type resource appear widget man page subject 117 dont work youre probably trying use function application code used internally widget function parent widget change geometry child promising function also use widget thi case child request change parent way ymy application request geometry change widget issue call setting geometry resource although thi result function called ymy application code must use standard interface risk widget datum becoming corrupted xlib call similarly avoided shouldnt used change subject 118 isnt call like although variou detail current implementation xt internal make difficult major reason call exist remain undefined set resource new widget resource typically set based location instance hierarchy resource change instance move happen widget child time semantic defined would probably little advantage destroying old widget creating new widget correct location desired resource setting resource correctly majority work creating new widget note possible toolkit david b lewi faq joe friday david b lewi temporarily speaking visual inc day evening
