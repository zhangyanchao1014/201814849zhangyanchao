manager lot window manager lot different feature ability choice use necessity act performance useful feature thi point agreed upon twm best candidate speedy window manager couple generic trick try soup ymy window turning unnecessary thing like move also lay ymy window manner reduce amount cpu power spent raising window joe english ive found good font aka biggest font know use sun screen still get two 80 column terminal window display font suggestion accepted x server server make sure ymy server proper match ymy hardware monochrome monitor use monochrome x11 server monochrome sun havent noticed much difference xsun colmy server however wa pointed 800k smaller therefore contribute le thank michael ymy server wa compiled also make difference jeff law advise u sun system x compiled gcc version 2 sun compiler expect get large server using bundled suno compiler assume similar result would occur used one commercial compiler market locking server ram ha anyone tried x server locked ram get eg vium call thi help performance ive one inquiry thi topic pointer function call hard evidence someone tried position give try thank eric c danny juan martin starting ymy server joe english start lot client ymy whatever sleep second two launching one changed script thi actually took le time heavily loaded system without much core though thi sound crazy confirmed work provided good explanation thi work start x server take huge amount time start accepting connection lot done server start thi proces touch large number page proces running time would fight server use cpu importantly memory put sleep give server chance get client start similarly also lot whenever x client program start toolkit registering widget resource program state databasis forth thi activity typically memory intensive thi done proces ha reached steady state memory usage typically settle using page using sleep launching ymy client ymy avoid fighting ymy workstation limited resource thi definitely ymy mileage may vary situation many variable considered available ram local swap space load average number user ymy system client starting etc currently situation like sleep 1 exec sleep 1 exec sleep 1 exec xterm sleep 1 exec xterm ive sleep 1 exec sleep 2 exec sleep 3 exec xterm sleep 4 exec xterm ive even tried sleep 2 exec sleep 1 exec sleep 1 exec sleep 1 exec xterm sleep 1 exec xterm idea thi last one wa make sure completely finished processing settled steady state sleep client launched fairly comparable result stuck current setup simplicity probably experiment bit find setup suit font loading font take time ram minimize number font ymy application use youll get speed increase time one simple strategy choose small number font one small one large one roman whatever suit configure ymy client least ymy heavily used client use font client program start quicker font already loaded server thi also server resource since fewer font loaded server joe english eg main xterm font also twm set use menu icon etc twm default font since dont normally use ive eliminated one font server oliver jone keep font local workstation rather loading nf make extensive use r5 font use font server resource file keep ymy xdefault file small save ram save server startup time joe english one suggestion ymy xdefault file try putting minimum number resource want available ymy application example true separate ymy resource individual resource file example ymy login file set environment variable compwindowsx frequently asked question faq contain excellent explanation environment variable work ed xterm launch load resource find forth note client follow pattern check ymy system appdefault directory often find proper name name ymy personal resource file name thi documented xt specification pg 125 666 thank kevin michael urban mike long kevin willing mail hi setup file thi method ymy personal resource ha following benefit easier maintain usable fewer resource stored x server property side benefit ymy server may start quicker since doesnt load ymy resource application proces resource never sort ymy resource find one affect also ha application interested ha load additional file every time start thi doesnt seem make much performance difference might consider thi huge application resource database need application without default run ymy xdefault file ymy resource split multiple resource file loaded individual client program watch thi c style comment xdefault file switched thi method distributed resource file spent several day trying figure client finding resource xt provide error message encountered c style comment resource file simply processing resource file los handy eg color enough cause person dismis thi method resource management may also run client break rule example neither emac xvt 10 find resource anywhere xdefault starting client machine share file machine ymy resource stored ymy client find resource loading ymy resource server guarantee ymy client alway find resource casey possible compromise suggestion planning trying put resource heavily used client eg xterm xdefault file use separate resource file method client seldom use define ymy display properly client program often executed machine server situation rather setting ymy display environment variable hostname name ymy workstation set ymy display variable 00 thi acces routine know server machine use shared memory method transferring request thank patrick j see display name section man page explanation properly set ymy display name dont think stock mit least datum general hp library smart enough use local communication even display isnt set specially rob jody sent xlib patch change stock r5 use local communication even display properly set dont want get busines trying patch elected include hopefully mit apply thi minor 8 line patch themself meantime want try email jody ed client megabyte ram think carefully number program running think also kind program running example smaller clock program unfortunately havent really noticed program advertise large u research spread word suggestion better alternative standard client eg xterm welcome ed ive received contradictory advice person subject x client program advocate use program strictly xlib based since xt xaw toolkit rather large warn u application using may already loaded one shared library thi case using example client program may actually increase amount ram consumed thi seem dont mix toolkit try use athena client xview client motif client etc use one youre dragging one toolkit library know ymy environment think carefully client program would work best together environment thank rob duncan better clock x 1 suggested duncan available exportlcsmitedu display clock title bar another program save screen real estate 2 suggested der mouse available non made look much like mit oclock mostly like purely changing resource course ultimate clock one consume resource take screen real estate one hang ymy wall better terminal emulator x readme file distributed xterm abandon hope ye enter thi undoubtedly ugly program distribution ugly maybe site still used suspect xterm one used client many site isnt better terminal emulator available see must use xterm try reducing number reduce memory usage oliver jone 1 xvt suggested richard available exportlcsmitedu dont need feature xterm get hold xvt wa written save swap space xterm rather hog thi wa written partial clone xterm dont rename ymy resource xvt pretend xterm current version bind key xterm ive heard version xvt thi feature ive found yet update march 1993 recently email conversation brian regarding xvt question whether xvt really faster xterm instance xvt may slightly faster compare speed try thi benchmark dd see program scroll faster also xterm may slightly larger ram requirement dont hard number anyone else shared library shared text segment mean xterm requirement major experiment ripped stuff xterm made little difference since never use never get brought memory stand conflicting report validity xvt xterm summary ymy mileage may vary provide hard datum id like see specifically much ram much swap need relative speed 2 suggested der mouse available also terminal emulator major lack person like anyway tuning ymy client suggestion tune ymy client program work faster scott barman scottasdcom come suggestion regarding motif text field widget noticed datum entry motif text field widget wa getting slight response particularly initial one field examining wa going found seem resource focu text field widget even text widget cursor every time cursor appear disappear widget widget code making request server user stop thi setting resource 0 noticeable sparc make little difference slower system thi specific suggestion probably applied general lot area consider ymy heavily used client minor turned thereby save server request miscellaneou suggestion pretty picture dont use large bitmap gif etc root window background complicated ymy root window bitmap slower server ymy screen window redraw etc take ram cpu power work sun sparc im consciou performance issue cant comprehend see person 4mb sun 360 running root window ill let someone else figure much ram would occupied full screen root image colmy workstation youre anything like need screen real estate get client rarely see root window anyway thank alex thi one ed quicker mouse using xset adjust fast ymy pointer move screen move ymy mouse use xset 3 10 file let send pointer acros screen wrist see xset man page idea information hint sometime may want slow ymy mouse tracking fine work cover option placed number different mouse setting command menu window manager eg twm menu mouse setting mouse setting fast xset 7 10 normal fast xset 3 10 system default xset default xset 0 10 programming thought joe english speed application youre developing ton thing stick motif program dont set resource individual button label list et al use whatever resource manager widget stick font possible better yet dont use motif absolute pig dont create destroy widget fly try thi avoid many problem buggy toolkit use line width 0 gc server thi make huge difference compres collapse multiple expose event thi make difference fast application completely one small remark heard using better function would greatly increase performance xt based application since use heavily suggested trying didnt find time yet test small program free difference indeed noticeable somewhat 5 time faster confirmation thi anyone ed andre beck unnecessary event person use fastest routine forget reset gc used thi cause event every case put load onto connection force client run thousand request thi context switching also seen one gc created heavily changed xt use definitely better mechanism caching sharing lot gc needed parameter thi remove load subsequent request connection moving toward client startup phase say contributor proposed idea seem right wall first david b lewi day night thi swap display someone else run ymy program machine display locally user run ymy machine onto display goal reduce context switch operation client server im situation easily try thi received following confirmation michael regularly run program machine notice big difference try run machine reduce net usage usually nice reduce impact thi help lot poor little 16 mb wa essential 8 mb casey x11 server client competing cpu ymy server run machine really major problem except x11 client server absolute context timothy h firstly rely fact cpu mostly idle x cpu usage chance ymy something time small get twice available ymy action second factor context switch expensive using 2 cpu half pay price due overhead going network thi offset case improved network typically v pipe allowing even fewer context switch source information volume 8 oreilly x window system series x window system administrator guide book x administrator read adrian nye lot tip performance paper improving x application
