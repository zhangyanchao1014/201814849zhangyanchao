american scientist hand felt wa proof wa huge sitting northern continent event u decided wait making verdict venu arrival radar probe scheduled later decade originally named venu orbiting imaging radar initial design wa scaled back craft wa venu radar eventually machine would called magellan magellan circa thi vehicle would map entire planet even detail venera time however soviet probe maintained distinction radar imaging wa ability venera next v radar antenna infrared latter measuring world temperature majority area covered registered five hundred degree degree fahrenheit location two hundred degree possibly indicating current activity probe also found cloud pole five eight kilometer three 48 mile lower contrast polar air sixty kilometer mile altitude wa five twenty degree atmosphere similar height main mapping mission ended july 1984 plan least one venera radar image surface unfortunately thi idea come pa orbiter may possessed enough ga perform operation venera 15 16

scientist explore planet air instrument professor french space agency centre national proposed idea far back 1967 joint balloon mission 1982 nevertheles late year 1984 dream would eventually come true two proton rocket sent december 15 21 soviet union provided western observer first clear full view booster launching every soviet venu probe since 1975 thi wa one many first complex mission probe launched space december named vega 1 2 word venera russian word spacecraft one mission perform also one celestial objective explore namely comet thi famou wa making latest return inner region solar system since last visit since wa widely believed comet remain formation solar system five billion year ago scientist around world gave high priority one body actually come close earth comet cold dark outer fringe solar system like variou force fall toward sun circle ice debris million kilometer solar encounter soviet union along european space agency esa japan institute space science isa wish mi thi first opportunity human history make close examination esa would using probe make close flyby comet japan first deep space craft pioneer comet would view much safer distance scientist united state also desired study comet space probe one time vessel powered solar sail engine however government budget cut nasa american effort u would make primarily observation sharing datum nation though instrument named dust counter designed chicago university professor john simpson wa added soviet mission may 1984 soviet answer vega instead building entirely new craft mission soviet decided modify venera bu design encounter comet performing advanced venu mission along way vega 1 2 reached venu bus would drop one use planet swing toward comet much u probe mariner 10 used venu flyby mercury year earlier soviet craft would head helping location comet probe kilometer mile away march 1986 planned two vega arrived venu june 1985 vega 1 released payload first ninth day month lander making descent toward planet craft touched upper atmosphere morning june 11 kilometer mile surface small wa released lander produced 55 kilometer 33 mile altitude thu first balloon probe ever explore venu successfully arrived one kilometer opening ga wa pumped plastic balloon diameter meter foot meter foot wa instrument package properly known top part consisted cone served antenna point balloon wa transmitter electronic instrument connected bottom wa measuring cloud particle wa painted special white finish keep bay acid planet atmosphere vega 1 balloon wa dropped night side venu north scientist concerned ga bag would burst heat daylight placed hemisphere give craft much time possible return datum thi action lander come dark well effectively removing camera system used previou mission author wonder though could used similar one attached venera 9 10 1975 soviet scientist thought planet surface wa perpetual due permanently thick cloud cover first balloon transmitted hour right day hemisphere battery failed covering kilometer mile threat day heat vega 1 balloon wa altitude dropping fifty kilometer thirty mile thi wa considered active three main cloud layer reported pioneer venu 1978 indeed balloon wa pushed acros planet speed 250 kilometer 150 mile per hmy strong vertical wind craft two three hundred meter foot journey layer air temperature forty degree 104 degree fahrenheit

vega 2 lander carrier bu past venu distance kilometer mile followed twin comet making closer flyby march 9 1986 kilometer mile probe helped reveal comet dark kilometer 84 mile acros rotating every 53 hour give take three hour since vega craft still functioning encounter soviet scientist considered option send probe celestial object one prime target wa near earth vega 2 could pa distance six million kilometer 36 million mile sadly soviet back opportunity become first nation fly spacecraft past wa discovered wa enough fuel probe reach planned vega 1 2 quietly shut early 1987 future plan impressive vega mission given scientist numerou idea hope even second world sun one example wa mission planned early 1990 thi collaboration called launch multiple probe single proton rocket either 1991 1992 craft would first swing venu drop several lander balloon probe would designed survive planet atmosphere one month large improvement vega balloon two day mission would head investigate several comet including possible landing thu mission name main belt seen earth unfortunately venu exploration plan began change soviet union 1986 soviet decided mission red planet mar instead venu keeping comet aspect intact thi time soviet space program interest wa mar already construction wa entirely new probe design called two member thi clas planned leave earth 1988 orbit mar next year 1 2 would place first instrument mar largest moon thi wa prelude even advanced mar including balloon probe soil sample return craft eventually human explorer early century environment venu wa hostile seriou consideration human near future thing began look soviet venu mar exploration probe failed complete mission one losing contact way red planet 1988 going silent mar orbit one week planned moon landing march 1989 1989 plan wa venu orbiter drop eight ten around planet several year later mission launch date wa moved year ha put hold official soviet mission venu since put forth sad commentary year continuou robotic exploration planet late 1980 political economic change wa taking soviet union president began open hi nation benefit increased cooperation rest nation particularly west culture became le oppressive past economy wa taking rough ride also effect free market effect hit everywhere including space program mission level cut back soviet began making almost desperate attempt cooperate nation either keep remaining program alive make money early 1992 wa reported soviet offering sale several venera storage price 16 million dollar incredibly low price planetary probe nation took meanwhile united state wa new venu mission magellan galileo u planetary exploration launch space shuttle may 4 1989 shuttle wa magellan spacecraft combination spare part u probe designed make detailed complete venu history magellan reached second world august 1990 would able map almost entire planet resolution 108 meter 360 foot ability venera 15 16 interim another american probe wa launched space shuttle would make quick flyby venu way orbit giant planet jupiter 1995 october 18 1989 shuttle released second planetary probe space named galileo famou italian astronomer discovered probe primary target major moon absence powerful enough booster send galileo direct flight planet probe wa sent around venu earth several time build enough speed reach jupiter result venu became galileo first planetary goal february 1990 probe back image planet cloud indication lightning violent atmosphere drawing board incredible succes magellan last year new plan laid journey venu u talked space scientist former soviet union independent state since january 1 1992 cooperative effort launch new venera lander mission within next decade japan indium esa also considered venu mission next decade february 1993 nasa came several new venu project part discovery program launching inexpensive probe throughout solar system venu two mission selected study venu mission involving landing small probe one hemisphere measure wind air temperature pressure venu composition probe designed study venu atmosphere thick air aid much soviet done since 1967 final project decision made 1994 human venu human ever able stand surface venu present temperature air pressure would threatening earth life protected something even venera lander plan looked changing environment venu something like earth however noted require removal much thick carbon atmosphere major reduction surface heat ability speed planet rotation rate something bit faster every earth day project may take century meantime effort made better understand venu exist today still yet fully know world seemingly similar earth many important way became instead deadly place earth ever suffer thi fate perhap venu hold answer answer may
