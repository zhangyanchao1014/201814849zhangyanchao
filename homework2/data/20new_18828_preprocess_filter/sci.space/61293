andy cohen subject report redesign team following feed u ha posted already number item seen yet redesign activity update following weekly statu redesign based information provided nasa headquarters station redesign team provided detailed statu report advisory committee redesign space station april 22 meeting wa held facility crystal city va topic covered included preliminary mission goal statement space station science technology engineering research assessment proces design approach discussion management option operation concept also held design team presented three option study option modular pete priest presented option priest said team working define station meet cost goal ha identified three distinct phase evolution power station human tended permanent presence team define minimum capability needed achieve phase total cost phase capability budget level option use current freedom hardware cost effective considering existing system socalled spacecraft orbiter power station capability could achieved 3 flight freedom photo module providing 20 power mission power station assumed thi phase human tended capability would provided addition u common module module add subsystem 9 payload rack port esa japanese laboratory mission orbiter station assumed thi phase different mode studied thi phase option b freedom derived mike griffin presented statu option b activity griffin detailed evolution option initial research capability capability permanent human presence capability two fault tolerance finally permanent human capability griffin also outlined proposed system change program minor change communication tracking system crew health care system major change datum management system initial research capability would achieved 2 flight degree inclination 3 flight degree consist extended duration combination segment 2 photo array providing power capability would achieved 6 flight add segment u lab permanent human presence capability would achieved 8 flight two orbiter providing assured crew return two fault tolerance achieved 11 flight would build section another set module thermal control propulsion system freedom derived configuration could achieve international complete state 16 flight three flight bring module third array two assured crew return vehicle would complete permanent human capability international stage griffin told redesign advisory committee eliminating hardware would meet budget guideline freedom derived option major reduction must occur area including program management contractor early operation cost said option c launch core station presented option c single launch core station concept shuttle external tank solid rocket booster would used launch station orbit shuttle main engine would mounted tail station module launch et separation module 23 foot diameter 92 foot long would provide foot volume separated 7 deck connected seven port would located variou place module place international module element thi would two fixed photo array producing approximately 40 power flying solar attitude hi closing comment redesign advisory committee bryan said design freeze would established 3 option april 26
