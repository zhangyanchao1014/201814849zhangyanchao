subject gamma ray burster stuff article kevin w write article david ward write given fact spacecraft attitude knowledge approx 2 might able figure well batse determine location rotational gamma ray burster knowledge map accuracy pr material three instrument give accuracy order fraction degree help believe fundamental difference x three instrument instrument le form image error limited craft attitude power optic batse altogether different beast effectively 8 coincidence counter one corner craft information differential signal arrival time detector error would determined timing error error craft attitude since none 8 detector resolution whatsoever used determine parallax indeed parallax would add small component error demonstrating beyond oort cloud would require resolution order since oort cloud extend 05 together parallax arc second distance object demonstrate one arc second parallax 2 au base line 3 degree accuracy reported true going add pluto fast flyby get enough beauty gife information watch entire sky simultaneously handy combination idea next burst coming kevin batse alone isnt alway used determine position particularly bright burst occur couple detector catch going pioneer 10 11 one im getting thi far enough away bright burst happen nearby huge created hopefully line general circle given batse get moderately accurate position say oh 2 3 degree closest anyone ha ever gotten actually advisor another mine talking day putting one detector one pluto satellite realized satellite alone carrying something like 200 pound well batse detector need lead shielding protect 1 alone weigh 200 pound decided jeremy
