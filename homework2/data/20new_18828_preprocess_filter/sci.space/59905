jon subject space faq 1015 planetary probe history archivename lastmodified date planetary probe historical mission thi section wa lightly adapted original posting larry mostly minor formatting change matthew contributed section voyager section wa obtained isa material posted u planetary mission mariner venu mar mercury flyby orbiter mariner 1 first u attempt send spacecraft venu failed minute launch 1962 guidance instruction ground stopped reaching rocket due problem antenna onboard computer took control however turned bug guidance software rocket went course range safety officer destroyed although bug sometime claimed incorrect fortran statement wa actually error bar indicating smoothing wa omitted expression sub n nth value radiu thi error led software treat normal minor variation velocity seriou leading incorrect compensation mariner 2 became first successful probe flyby venu december 1962 returned information confirmed venu hot 800 degree fahrenheit revised 900 degree f world atmosphere composed primarily carbon acid wa later confirmed 1978 mariner 3 launched november 5 1964 wa lost protective failed craft wa placed space unable collect sun energy power solar panel probe soon died battery ran solar orbit wa intended mar flyby mariner 4 mariner 4 sister probe mariner 3 reach mar 1965 took first image martian surface 22 flew planet probe found world atmosphere much previously thought many scientist concluded thi preliminary scan mar wa dead world biological sense mariner 5 wa sent venu 1967 datum planet collected five year earlier mariner 2 plu information venu atmospheric pressure surface least 90 time earth equivalent foot surface ocean mariner 6 7 sent mar 1969 expanded upon work done mariner 4 fmy year earlier however failed take away concept mar dead planet first made basic measurement mariner 4 mariner 8 ended atlantic ocean 1971 rocket launcher failed mariner 9 sister probe mariner 8 became first craft orbit mar 1971 returned information red planet probe done revealing huge martian surface well giant canyon system evidence water acros planet probe also took first detailed image mar two small moon mariner 10 used venu gravity assist mercury 1974 probe return first image atmosphere revealing previously detail cloud cover plu fact entire cloud system circle planet fmy earth day mariner 10 eventually made three flyby mercury 1974 1975 running attitude control ga probe revealed mercury heavily world much greater thought thi would seem indicate mercury ha iron core make 75 percent entire planet pioneer moon sun venu jupiter saturn flyby orbiter pioneer 1 3 failed meet main objective photograph moon reach far enough space provide new information area earth moon including new datum van allen radiation belt earth three craft failure rocket launcher pioneer 1 wa launched october 11 1958 pioneer 2 november 8 pioneer 3 december 6 pioneer 4 wa moon probe missed moon became first u spacecraft orbit sun pioneer 5 wa originally designed flyby venu mission wa scaled instead studied environment venu earth million kilometer 1960 record mariner 2 pioneer 6 9 placed solar orbit 1965 1968 pioneer 6 7 8 still information thi time pioneer e would number 10 suffered launch failure 1969 pioneer 10 became first spacecraft flyby jupiter 1973 pioneer 11 followed 1974 went become first probe study saturn 1979 vehicle continue function 1995 heading interstellar space first craft ever pioneer venu 1 1978 also known pioneer venu orbiter pioneer 12 burned atmosphere october 8 1992 made first radar study planet surface vium probe pioneer venu 2 also known pioneer 13 sent fmy small probe atmosphere december 1978 main spacecraft bu burned high atmosphere fmy probe toward surface though none expected survive surface day probe make transmitted minute ground battery failed ranger lunar lander impact mission ranger 1 2 test probe ranger lunar impact series meant high earth orbit testing 1961 rocket problem left useles low orbit quickly ranger 3 launched january 26 1962 wa intended land instrument surface moon problem launch caused probe mi moon head solar orbit ranger 3 try take image moon flew camera wa unfortunately aimed deep space attempt ranger 4 launched april 23 1962 purpose ranger 3 suffered technical problem crashed lunar first u probe reach moon albeit without returning datum ranger 5 launched october 18 1962 similar ranger 3 4 lost solar panel battery power eventually missed moon solar orbit ranger 6 9 modified lunar mission send back live image lunar surface headed toward impact moon ranger 6 failed thi objective 1964 camera operate ranger 7 9 performed well becoming first u lunar probe return thousand lunar image 1965 lunar orbiter lunar surface photography lunar orbiter 1 5 designed orbit moon image variou site studied landing area manned apollo mission probe also contributed greatly understanding lunar surface feature particularly lunar five probe series launched 1967 essentially successful mission first u probe orbit moon lo eventually crashed lunar surface avoid interference manned apollo mission lunar soft lander series designed primarily see apollo lunar module could land surface moon without soil thi time wa feared moon wa covered great layer dust would support heavy landing vehicle wa successful proving lunar surface wa strong enough hold spacecraft 1968 2 4 mission rest became first u probe soft land moon taking thousand image soil analysi apollo 12 landed 600 foot 3 1969 returned part craft earth 7 last series wa purely scientific mission region 1968 viking mar orbiter lander viking 1 wa launched cape florida august 20 1975 titan rocket probe went martian orbit june 19 1976 lander set western july 20 1976 soon began programmed search martian still debate whether probe found life sent back incredible color surrounding one thing scientist learned wa mar sky wa color dark blue originally thought sky pink due sunlight dust particle thin atmosphere lander set among field red sand boulder far camera could image viking 1 orbiter kept functioning august 7 1980 ran lander wa switched mode hoped would keep functioning 1994 november 13 1982 command sent lander accidentally telling shut order communication wa never despite engineer effort may 1983 interesting side note viking 1 lander ha designated thoma memorial station honor late leader lander imaging team national air space museum washington dc station attached lander manned viking 2 wa launched september 9 1975 arrived martian orbit august 7 1976 lander touched september 3 1976 accomplished essentially task sister lander exception worked recording one orbiter series ga leak 1978 shut july lander wa shut april 12 1980 orbit viking orbiter decay around voyager outer planet
