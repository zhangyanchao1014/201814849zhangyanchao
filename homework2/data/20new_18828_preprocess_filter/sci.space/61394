david palmer subject gamma ray burster stuff henryzootorontoedu henry spencer write article write actually advisor another mine talking day putting one detector one pluto satellite realized satellite alone carrying something like 200 pound well batse detector need lead shielding protect 1 alone weigh 200 pound actually situation even worse total pluto fast flyby spacecraft pound support equipment like power communication available instrument maybe 10 dont think batse fit pluto fast flyby instrument definition research instrument payload constraint allocation 7 lb power allocation 6 watt required instrument visible imaging system 750 mm fl optic ir mapping array 03 energy resolution uv nm 05 nm resolution radio science incorporated telecom system mean thi doesnt leave much room payload totally mission spacecraft addition power come thermal generator whole space craft 2 foot diameter boom mean strong associated background tend reduce sensitivity somewhat would still nice group looking david palmer
