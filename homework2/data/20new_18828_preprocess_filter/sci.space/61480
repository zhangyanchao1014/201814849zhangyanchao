subject boeing wa word chairman boeing write response boeing ssto far single stage orbit technology think better answer two stage approach talking customer far long way anybody know anything thi really news thi threaten work dc boeing ha looking several vehicle ha carried extensive study advanced launch system time good reference thi might comparison propulsion option advanced application va le boeing paper describe launch system claimed achieve operational efficiency without problem associated liquid hydrogen fuel basically highspeed airplane launching design concept also called betum laid paper launch least 10000 pound polar orbit 20000 pound space station orbit including crew eight person life support system design reliability betum first stage powered two large 12 high speed civil transport long orbiter first stage aircraft also could accommodate longer heavy payload second stage launch orbital vehicle first stage take like normal accelerate mach 3 point modified burn would shut would take mach 55 orbiter would swing ignite proceed orbit vehicle would land like aircraft conclusion respective mission estimated total weight combined configuration 15 lb roughly fully loaded orbiter stage weigh including propane power two 250 vacuum thrust rocket engine would stored 91 degree propane tank mounted forward cargo bay orbiter crew station would stored claim key thi design succes efficient compact allowed fuel paper compare design ssto design conclude ssto ha slightly lower cost easier cheaper le risky develop simpler build ha greater safety mission doesnt carry hydrogen fuel major use airplane type engine fuel well inherent self capability probably system likely provide close operation possible practical configuration single stage concept shown viable thi really news thi threaten work dc boeing working design time expect thi similar concept perhap ssto proposed sdio ssto first phase examined basi bid first phase threaten dc possibly set ongoing study trying government future space transportation strategy boeing well firm providing datum joint study team back dc variou option attention including shuttle upgrade shuttle replacement wa called architecture upgrade variou advanced vehicle betum dc ssto several type etc trying put together strategy future u govt space transportation system trying launch need like dod nasa need including commercial consideration investment risk going leap frog new technology like betum heck problem worst part problem isnt arent promising idea concept dozen balance cost risk versu real need near term draft report final report coming end year wale space technology investor
