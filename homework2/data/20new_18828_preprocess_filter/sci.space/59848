jon subject space faq controversial question archivename lastmodified date controversial question issue periodically come much argument fact offered summary attempt represent position much net community ha settled please dont bring unles something truly new discussed net cant set public policy ymy representative happened saturn v plan despite widespread belief contrary saturn v lost kept marshall space flight center problem saturn v finding drawing finding vendor supply hardware like guidance system component fact launch pad converted space shuttle use place launch time redesign accommodate available hardware launch pad may well started scratch clean sheet design datum space mission isnt immediately available investigator associated nasa mission allowed exclusive acces one year datum obtained order give opportunity analyze datum publish result without person mission however nasa frequently release example form eg photo public early mission risk nuclear power source space probe ha extensive discussion thi topic attempt block galileo launch ground thermal source dangerou numerou study claim even scenario shuttle explosion launch accidental velocity risk extremely
