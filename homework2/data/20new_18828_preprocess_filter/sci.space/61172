jbh55289uxacsouiucedu josh hopkin subject trajectory simulation ive three talk last month might interest ive note since note taking ability mean infallible please assume factual error mine permission granted copy thi without restriction note deltum clipper project toward producing single orbit launch vehicle dcx vehicle 13 scale vehicle designed test concept ssto currently test vehicle would full scale experimental vehicle capable reaching orbit ha yet funded april 6th rocky nelson dougla gave talk entitled technique advanced space mission university illinoi mr nelson job involf using software trajectory determine trajectory within given requirement although directly involved deltum clipper project ha spent time recently using hi software application thu used project hi example dont think detail trajectory simulation much interest reader hope arent fell asleep part think many interested detail example first example given wa payload polar orbit main restriction acceleration must remain 3 g assume thi driven passenger constraint rather hardware constraint verify deltum clipper version ha 8 engine 4 booster 4 booster lower shut thu one critical question shut mr nelson showed following plot acceleration v time 3 g ascius graph go thi actually fairly good big difference line 2 g made curf datum approximate graph wasnt long 1 g 0 g 100 sec 400 sec mentioned critical constraint g level must kept 3 initially eight engine started vehicle burn fuel increase get close booster engine back however quickly become low power soon make sense cut altogether thi cause dip 100 second eventually remaining engine bring g level back 3 hold cut entirely engine occur orbit trajectory aimed altitude slightly higher desired last air drag slow vehicle slightly thu final altitude desired question audience q would make sense shut booster engine pair rather worth considering yet done simulation fmy wa part problem given q wa final payload thi trajectory cant tell u read aviation leak also apparently good propulsion example wa told use question anyone know thi security due sdio protecting national security md protecting interest second example wa simulation orbit pitch biggest constraint thi one heating parameter trying wa showed graph heating using two different model show similar think supposed assume thi meant accurate end result wa polar orbit landing would 30 degree would start profile 60 degree south would asked landing didnt know aspect flight profile josh hopkin jbh55289uxacsouiucedu find way make one attributed
