entirely one component motion existing three dimension discrete unit two form space time 2 physical universe conform relation ordinary mathematics magnitude absolute geometry two postulate larson developed complete theoretical universe using variou combination rotational rotational motion concept outward motion speed relation speed light larson called unit velocity natural datum step development larson wa able match object hi theoretical universe object real physical universe particle incomplete atom charge atom molecule star cluster galaxy binary star system solar system white star etc even object yet discovered exploding galaxy burst applying hi theory hi new model atom larson wa able precisely accurately calculate atomic distance crystal molecule thermal expansion solid property matter thi described good detail without fancy complex mathematics hi book book dewey b larson following complete list late physicist dewey b larson book hi comprehensive general unified theory physical universe early book print still available loan structure physical universe case nuclear atom 1963 beyond newton 1964 new light space time 1965 1971 nothing motion 1979 950 substitute 83 billion super last fmy chapter explain chemical fact science 1982 universe motion 1984 final solution mystery basic property matter 1988 last book published north pacific publisher po box portland available vium loan ymy local university public library doesnt several including last one available international society unified science isu e ave salt lake city utah thi organization wa started promote larson theory related publication including quarterly journal physicist dewey b larson background physicist dewey b larson wa retired engineer chemical electrical wa 91 year old died may 1989 science degree engineering science oregon state university developed hi comprehensive general unified theory physical universe trying develop way compute chemical property based element used larson lack fancy phd degree might one reason orthodox physicist ignoring valid reason sometime take relative clearly see forest tree time clear hi book also knew orthodox physic astronomy well physicist astronomer well enough point contradiction ad hoc assumption principle etc larson fund etc test hi theory wa necessary simply compared variou part hi theory researcher experimental datum many case hi explanation fit better theory much orthodox physicist astronomer claim looking unified field theory work ignoring one 30 year modern physic explain physical universe well part larson book full quotation leading orthodox physicist astronomer agree remember crystal sphere flat earth theory etc also seemed explain well later proved wrong prof frank h meyer professor strong proponent larson theory wa still president larson organization international society unified science editor quarterly journal moved super super texa anywhere else would gros waste money contribute almost nothing scientific value physicist dont realize according comprehensive general unified theory late physicist dewey b larson described hi book strange particle alleged etc finding existing lab etc really atom antimatter created beam quickly like cosmic ray incompatible environment larger expensive create element antimatter physicist seen physicist even confused type antimatter atom worth 83 billion cost dont much important use thi wasted money another thing consider primary proposed location texa ha seriou growing problem kind fire eating insulation underground cable much ground ground water required keep super ronald proposed totally absurd built named leading particle physicist antimatter larson comprehensive general unified theory physical universe antimatter simple case opposite charge type particle ha rate vibration rotation made relation rotational equivalent speed light larson call unit velocity natural datum larson theory actually particle matter antimatter electron meet rotational vibration charge rotation respective made larson theory antimatter half physical universe ha three dimension time one dimension space exist relationship material half relativity point orbit planet mercury ha observed precisely measured advance rate second arc per century second thi advance attributed vium calculation gravitational planet venu earth jupiter etc remaining 43 second arc used help prove einstein general theory relativity late physicist dewey b larson achieved result closer 43 second general relativity instead using special relativity one hi book applied transformation high orbital speed mercury larson totally rejected general relativity another mathematical fantasy also rejected special relativity including part increase near speed light use transform shift greater 1000 really moving faster speed light although motion away u time larson comprehensive general unified theory physical universe three dimension time instead one two dimension measured material half physical universe one dimension measure clock time low relative speed value two dimension high speed become significant transformation must used factor larson often used term coordinate time writing thi regard increase ha proven atomic accelerator acceleration drop toward zero near speed light formula acceleration acceleration force fm orthodox physicist ignoring third factor force larson theory stay constant force drop toward zero force actually motion combination motion relation motion including outward motion expansion universe example outward motion inherent universe result socalled big bang yet another mathematical fantasy universe motion wish recommend everyone book universe motion dewey b larson 1984 north pacific publisher po box portland oregon page contain portion general unified theory physical universe developed author geniu thirty year ago contain final solution mystery including formation galaxy binary multiple star system solar system true origin background radiation cosmic ray gamma ray burst true nature white exploding galaxy etc contain astronomer looking ready seriously consider open mind following example hi theory succes hi first book structure physical universe larson predicted existence exploding galaxy several year astronomer started finding necessary consequence larson comprehensive theory discovered immediate related explanation also burst astronomer still head mysteriou burst originally thought originate neutron star disc galaxy new gamma ray telescope earth orbit ha detecting direction source location space correspond known object except case coincidence burst necessary consequence general unified theory physical universe developed late physicist dewey b larson according page 386 hi book universe motion published 1984 burst coming explosion antimatter half physical universe larson call cosmic sector relationship antimatter material half physical universe way connected together burst pop material half anywhere space seemingly random thi source location burst correspond known object come direction wonder close u space source location would burst kill life earth would way predict one stop perhap past blamed impact comet asteroid actually caused nearby burst binary star formation half star galaxy sun binary double orthodox astronomer still satisfactory theory form many binary star system actually likely consequence comprehensive general unified theory physical universe developed late physicist dewey b larson try summarize larson explanation detailed chapter 7 hi book universe motion hi book first according larson star generate energy fusion small fraction come slow gravitational collapse rest result complete annihilation heavy element heavier iron element ha destructive temperature limit heavier element lower thi limit star internal temperature increase grow vium decay product cosmic ray gradually reaching destructive temperature limit lighter lighter element internal temperature star reach destructive temperature limit iron type explosion thi much iron present related structure iron atom atom building proces larson explain hi book better star explode lighter material outer portion star blown outward space le speed light heavier material center portion star wa already around close speed light high temperature explosion push material speed light expand outward time equivalent space often actually disappear long period time mass start fall back material blown outward space start form red giant star material blown outward time start form white star star start moving back toward main sequence opposite direction hr diagram chance two mass falling back exact location space making single lone star near zero instead form binary system orbiting according larson white star ha density surface material center widely blown outward time thi eliminate need resort mathematical fantasy matter neutron star black hole etc solar system formation heavy material center exploding star relatively small instead single white star several mini white star around red giant star probably still far away time affected heat etc become planet chapter 7 universe motion larson used thi information principle hi comprehensive general unified theory physical universe derive hi version law black hole fantasy heard physicist stephen w hawking recently completed theoretical mathematical analysi two black hole together single black hole concluded new black hole would sum two original black hole result recognized everyone red flag causing widespread doubt whole idea black hole etc reading physicist dewey b larson book hi comprehensive general unified theory physical universe especially hi book universe motion clear black hole nothing mathematical fantasy strange object massive white star black hole orthodox astronomer physicist badly want prove theory way understand much publicity given physicist stephen hawking physicist astronomer seem acting hawking severe physical problem somehow make wish attention given physicist dewey b larson wa still alive widespread publicity attention given larson theory book organization international society unified science electromagnetic propulsion heard concept many year ago connection never wa able find work constructed found possible clue might work page book basic property matter late physicist dewey b larson describe part larson comprehensive general unified theory physical universe quote one paragraph indicated chapter development theory universe motion totally different concept nature electrical resistance electron find derived environment wa brought volume larson book nothing motion physical process operation produce electron substantial quantity although motion constitute electron many case atomic structure opportunity thi type motion structure limited follow alway large exces free electron material sector material half universe thi state electron move respect extension space inherently rotating unit space relation space space motion open space therefore electron remain permanently location respect natural reference system manner context spatial reference system electron like carried outward speed light progression natural reference system material thu exposed electron similar radiation meanwhile process discussed later whereby electron returned environment electron population material earth therefore level note larson theory electron also basically light particular frequency unit frequency around one axi particular rate unit rate unit velocity speed light rotational equivalent speed light according larson theory might label mixed larson saying outer space filled le electron flying around speed light thi true electromagnetic propulsion field spacecraft might able interact electron particle space perhap giving charge shooting toward rear achieve propulsion larson theory electrical charge rotational vibration particular frequency unit frequency rotation particle paragraph quoted might also give clue confused lightning generated cloud physic comprehensive general unified theory physical universe developed late physicist dewey b larson ha available 30 year published hi first book structure physical universe totally hawking sacred priest religion call science physic astronomy etc well scientific literature education system totally ignore larson theory ha larson theory ha excellent explanation many thing orthodox physicist astronomer burst nature larson theory deserve honestly openly discussed physic chemistry astronomy journal u elsewhere least basic principle larson theory included related course cambridge cornell university elsewhere student kept dark worthy alternative dogma fed information answer ymy question etc please consult cited source especially larson book reproduction thi important partial summary encouraged robert e b physic astronomy
