guy kuo subject quadra clock modification long modified quadra 700 higher speed previously using variable speed cpu thi modification testing stable higher speed ymy mileage may vary top speed achieve predicted hand personal ha tested fine 32 mhz thu far didnt higher speed clock oscillator hand test higher speed part clock oscillator 4 pin ttl variety need selection speed beginning 50 mhz cpu run 12 oscillator speed original one 50 mhz unit recommend getting 50 mhz clock case damage existing one obtained clock oscillator le 500 part number 50 mhz ttl clock oscillator part 62 mhz ttl clock oscillator part 66 mhz ttl clock oscillator part dont get half size clock oscillator wont fit also cmo clock oscillator havent tried one quadra work fine iisi socket obtain 4 pin socket form factor 14 pin dip package alternatively use 4 socket pin style socket cut socket cooling fan small 12 volt fan keep cpu cool must came specially modified fan built onto connector tapped hard drive power cable rig something similar risk ymy cpu procedure 1 insert usual disclaimer warning 2 remove top machine see floppy disk hard drive mounted plastic tower follow usual precaution course make sure machine thi cable wall monitor power supply cord back mac 3 remove power supply pulling plastic tab tower forward simultaneously pulling power supply straight tab piece plastic left aspect tower extend hook power supply may also feel shaped piece right portion power supply leave alone plastic tab tower need release 4 look rear tower assembly see flat ribbon scsi connector hard drive power cable flat ribbon cable leading floppy drive motherboard hard drive power cable connector ha tab must release 5 drive activity led clear plastic mount 6 look section plastic tower phillip head screw base remove taking care drop case bit ymy helpful 7 remove tower assembly pulling plastic tab right side tower thi tab prevent tower sliding slide entire tower assembly 1 cm lift tower assembly straight case 8 remove interrupt switch assembly shaped plastic device left front edge motherboard pull middle rear plastic prong forward entire device release 9 speaker cable squeeze plastic tab speaker free swing backward free case 10 remove motherboard form case lift front right corner motherboard 1 mm thi allows clear clear plastic power light guide slide motherboard forward 1 cm motherboard come directly 11 locate 50 mhz clock crystal small metal box near cpu chip note remember orientation new clock oscillator must pin 1 orientation carefully remove old clock oscillator pin may bent simply sure ymy iron hot enough heating board used iron accomplish thi task thi appropriate first soldering experience motherboard design fine trace easily damaged without proper care 12 install ymy socket socket pin old oscillator wa 13 put 50 mhz clock oscillator new socket could use old clock ha solder pin thi may come inside socket cause problem later suggest using new 50 mhz clock 14 install ymy cooling fan system complete modification 14 motherboard slide place 15 interrupt switch assembly speaker lock mother board firmly plug speaker wire back motherboard 16 reinstall tower assembly first placing right wall tower right wall case tower assembly 1 cm intended position lower tower assembly place maintaining contact right wall case fully slide tower assembly click place 17 motherboard end cable forget floppy drive cable 18 replace phillip head screw 19 drop power supply straight place click 20 plug hard drive activity light back clear plastic mount 21 ymy cable power cord cro ymy finger turn mac make usual power doesnt something immediately turn power ymy well sincere hopefully work normally turn machine back replace 50 mhz clock oscillator faster one reboot need fully test machine many hour deciding particular speed truly usable machine might take 8 hour operation occur brief time since clock oscillator 36 hour single problem good luck attempt thi modification small real risk could well reach quadra 950 speed higher le 50 part guy kuo
