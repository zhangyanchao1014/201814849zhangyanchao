david c subject move datum fast enough want achieve overall throughput rate around 5 megabyte sec large datum transfer around 5 mb quadra 950 nubu network card pump datum mac memory 85 mb using transfer highspeed disk array asynchronou pb call achieve 68 mb let say transfer go disk buffer network card enough first transfer datum disk buffer transfer datum buffer card 68 mb 85 mb result overall 38 mb slow tried following scheme transfer step 1 load 1st mb disk buffer step 2 send 1st mb card load 2nd mb disk buffer step 3 send 2nd mb card load 3rd mb disk buffer step n send n1 mb card load nth mb disk buffer step n1 send nth mb card even though code apparently execute card transfer card use mac cpu using buffer tho step 2 n take long two transfer executed one another improvement rate mac ram nubu card disk driver acces datum time problem two device card disk driver use bu mac ram anything david david get tired thinking thing dont want
