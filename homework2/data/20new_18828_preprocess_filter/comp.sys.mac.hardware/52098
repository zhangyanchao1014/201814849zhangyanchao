guy kuo subject iisi clock poll result long thi poll wa conducted help user decide whether alter iisi clock oscillator attempted gather many case history possible find estimate succes risk number reply probably show rare thi modification give impression succes rate may higher previou 80 estimate 24 24 machine able run 25 mhz add board present thi scientific survey best work thank contributed thi poll issue speed 25 mhz 275 mhz appear norm machine without add card reported machine able use 25 mhz long add card present several apple nubu card use machine nubu adapter wa able go faster 25 mhz one wasnt even able achieve 25 mhz nubu adapter place speed 32 33 mhz startup sound distorted hi density floppy disk problem reported note unles specifically listed machine tested higher speed clock failure hence 25 mhz operational machine may well work higher speed damage one user reported pulling one pad thi wa machine operational one reported pulling pin original clock oscillator one second hand report user putting motherboard soldering iron report static discharge damage report high speed operation causing damage also dont report user defective add board compatibility appear problem apple nubu adapter several add board used succes see case history heat sink virtually modified machine heat sink installed often style power transistor type used used heat sink compound wa also use bolt hole motherboard case history speed effective cpu speed 12 clock oscillator reported cpu version 20 mhz 1 275 mhz operational ran 10 minute 31 mhz crashing fpu add card cpu 24 damage installation 2 275 mhz operational without apple nubu adapter 25 mhz top speed apple nubu card installed cpu 24 floppy problem damage installation 3 275 mhz operational unable boot 31 mhz cpu floppy problem damage installation 4 25 mhz operational work following two configuration fpu adaptor card cache card b fpu adaptor card video 5 33 mhz operational fuzzy startup sound problem hi density disk 6 33 mhz operational fuzzy startup sound heat sink cpu chip right cpu 7 25 mhz operational occasional crash 33 mhz 8 25 mhz operational using fpu rated 16 mhz without difficulty 9 25 mhz operational pd adapter spectrum graphic card fpu heat sink cpu 10 25 mhz operational 33 mhz failed several hour 11 25 mhz operational upgrade 12 25 mhz operational tried 33 mhz system wont start heat sink cpu configured card cache cpu continuously problem floppy work fine 25 mhz 13 25 mhz operational heat sink cpu 14 25 mhz operational heat sink cpu 15 25 mhz operational heat sink cpu 16 25 mhz operational heat sink cpu 17 25 mhz operational heat sink cpu hour per day 18 25 mhz operational heat sink cpu cooling fan floppy problem 25 mhz 19 20 mhz operational soon startup 25 mhz nubu adapter 20 mhz rated cpu ram 70 n slot 80 motherboard 20 25 mhz operational heat sink added cpu later damage apple nubu adapter fpu installed 21 25 mhz operational heat sink cpu 22 25 mhz operational heat sink cpu 23 25 mhz operational heat sink cpu 24 25 mhz operational heat sink cpu guy kuo
