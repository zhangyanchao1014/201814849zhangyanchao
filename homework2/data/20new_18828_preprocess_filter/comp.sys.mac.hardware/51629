jason subject lc ram upgrade slow andrew write speak dale quite sure macintosh use full 16bit 32bit datum path full advantage running fast two fmy simm would one simm may assuming 32bit datum path get first byte first simm second byte second thi would mean memory actually split among fmy simm one byte hand could simm word byte could memory memory controller deal datum path one ha suspect though extent 32 bit read written thi would indicate interleave confusing thi new machine interleave two simm sort although seem sort idea get essential 64bit datum path ro excuse ram instead 32bit one ye cpu cant handle writing address speed something dale right simm byte allowing full datum bu common usenet particular everyone else conclusion drawn thi im trying figure kind memory configuration lc iius 32bit would fastest idea thank jason jason scott technology sufficiently advanced magic cat exist arthur c clarke may care lion
