belief absolute irrational belief absolute strongly fanatism deletion theism fanaticism neither said fanatism caused theism theism lead fanatism point theism increase chance becoming fanatic one could

considered bogu said theism factor fanatism point theism factor ymy claim back consider ymy argument useful following belief strongly fanaticism therefore belief factor fanaticism true utterly useles note thi belief belief god say least backed read first statement read absence evidence point latter fallacy wrong analogy saying someone believe something hardly information person saying someone theist hold much information correlation theist fanatism higher belief fanatism special feature belief truth blatant assertion evidence blind obedience authority lack reliable indicator really dangerou person source fanaticism often none thing cynical know precisely claim support please note especially field theism leader believe say believe youre incredibly naive frank odwyer living dream world wonder base discussion left statement matter fact think ignorant human nature even one start something one believe one get easily fooled actually believing one say give benefit doubt prove ymy statement proof make think theist leader believe say especially say one thing another say one thing closely followed opposite practice restricted theism anyone see almost thi country instance harder pa thru eye needle catholic church wealthy church square inch country brand theism precisely theist tend fanaticism grant tar theist thi brush bigotry reasoned argument read like censorship

straw man interesting nothing better offer said read like warm irrational bogu ha use creating nice split mind person found either side church wall blah blah blah quite well aware giving everyone right protect better fanatic way round course person alway fanatic never oneself ymy wish theist seem pretty quite nice see actually implying connection argument rise fanatism far another ymy assertion 2 define irrational belief eg rational believe reason alway useful irrational belief belief based upon reason latter ha discussed long time charley wingate one point belief violate reason often another proces lend rational analysi contain reliable information well paradox argument reason useful based reason would circular argument based reason would irrational bogu self reference circular since evaluation possible within rational system allowed ok still question however though certainly allowed rational claiming rational another ymy assertion proof evidence claim hey learned good risk repeating hearing didnt hear refutation back deal cant use reason demonstrate reason useful someone think reason crap wont buy see weak even latter imply proof depend opinion somehow accept triangle wont accept wow incredible insight dont prove wrong opinion possible show system leave useful information respectively claim even absurd statement information totally circular totally useles wish believe make believe thing judge appeal information make feel good believe may good contain possible belief despite contrary evidence bogu proof attempt truth blatant assertion ive seen many bogu proof nonexistence god existence rational system way mean every datum ha come logical analysi point evaluation datum contradict logic easily follow system allows evaluate rational ye possible evaluate rational system rational fallacy system since validity axiom agreed upon ha little impact possibility demon ala thi doesnt parse sorry far matter consistency use argument show system consistent isnt evaluation thi prediction need contradict however ymy argument silly proving mathematical statement need mathematics mathematics circular anybody else think wa silly stream consciousnes typing supposed mean first part second statement contain information dont say belief belief strong theism andor strong atheism ymy statement general true second part ymy sentence patently false datum lend rational analysi assumed contain reliable information regardles proces used obtain ive speaking religiou system contradictory definition god datum lend rational analysi say often fallacy look discussion axiom choice one evaluate axiom larger system usually derived exist derived want way one test consistency set axiom trying say point person alway wind saying thi datum reliable particular reason example nope evidence trick choice basi system difficult possibility one therefore choose least assumption assumption necessary get information system anyway id like see thi alleged evidence one need define axiom order define evaluation method foundation laid one feel one feel see irrational belief fanatic never compared evidence theist claim strength demand make whole thing irrational cant agree thi specific theism say theism necessarily require proof suspect using definition god personal supernatural entity objective effect thi world usually connected moral andor way world work imo belief god necessarily irrational mean person hold principle opposed exercise intelligence atheist also scientist example dont use theism science wouldnt science please note subjective datum lend themself scientific treatment well prohibit objective statement ergo nothing objective fair enough fanatism easily seen ha true believe nothing work hypothesi however belief say work hypothesi dont understand thi ymy argument person believe system b becuase sound nice make b true best work hypothesi however content b true work hypothesi testing evidence therefore b already believed say wrong waste time possible depending content b killed thi interesting effect definition interesting sure show belief god content speak arent catholic neighbour killing protestant example maybe dont believe maybe b assert b important belief god entirely irrelevant certainly seem axe example ymy neighbour fallacy ymy neighbour dont say little time exactly happened nope fallacy doesnt go correlation wish see tell irrelevant statement holy book please note one could edit relevant anymore god dont say message excuse holy book come theist saying genocide ordered god ok god easiest way excuse anything therefore highly fanatic mention effect interpretation fanatic rest believer happen god neither easiest way excuse anything way frank odwyer im evelyn
