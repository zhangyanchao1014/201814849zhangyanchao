subject technology technology robert e physicist hundred year ago everybody knew machine could possibly fly would violate law physic expert authority said example simon declared demonstration possible combination known substance known form known form force united practical machine man shall fly long distance air seem writer complete possible demonstration physical fact fortunately smart person wright brother accept final word take airplane granted except crash today orthodox physicist scientist saying similar thing several kind free energy technology using negative term perpetual motion citing socalled law assert energy created destroyed 1st law alway decrease useful energy 2nd law physicist know certain thing declare thing done principle common orthodox modern science help cover contradiction orthodox modern theory free energy device tap seemingly unlimited supply energy universe burning kind fuel making perfect solution worldwide energy crisi associated pollution degradation environment free energy device probably create energy rather tap existing natural energy source variou form unlike solar wind device need little energy storage capacity tap much energy needed needed solar energy ha disadvantage sun often blocked cloud tree building earth reduced thick atmosphere low altitude high likewise wind speed widely variable often nonexistent neither solar wind power suitable directly power car airplane properly designed free energy device limitation example least three u patent far awarded motor run exclusively permanent seemingly energy earth magnetic field first two require feedback network order third one described detail science mechanic magazine spring 1980 amazing motor page front cover require critical size shape orientation feedback motor could drive electric generator one home year round free complete copy u patent 300 u patent office jefferson davi va correct patent number required try getting copy article patent vium ymy local public university library loan dept second type device gray motor u patent tesla coil motor joseph newman see science page tap electromagnetic energy earth 12 cycle per second plu typically spark gap circuit serve energy coil energy tapped important total device combine frequency earth order power output thi output also increased spark gap neutral center strong permanent case tesla coil choke coil around secondary coil enhance output power earth energy propulsion power system john 1976 health research po box 70 hill ca 1930 civil engineer named invented partially developed german name lack differently shaped developing sophisticated mathematical equation explain described book new source dan 1977 water pumped pump coil reach critical velocity water longer inside wall drife pump convert pump motor electric generator device seem energy earth rotation vium effect like also gravity fourth type free energy device air motor u patent cro diesel engine ha three cylinder compression ratio 27 1 engine solar planetary gear burn fuel become driving air compressor thi engine also generate lot heat could used heat building high torque make ideal large truck preventing slowing hill david also real original automatic transmission differential drive crystal may someday used supply energy shown star trek show perhap one metal capacitor plate beam particle small radioactive source like used common household smoke detector one energy source mentioned despite fact fit definition free energy american physicist named joseph ha invented partially developed atomic fusion reactor call use fuel available nearly unlimited quantity sea water produce radioactive waste converted directly electricity without steam constructed small enough power house large enough power city unlike laser fusion read work already producing least three watt power every watt put new time u version page cold fusion experiment news lately originally conducted university utah researcher b stanley martin u navy researcher china lake naval weapon center californium direction mile finally took trouble collect coming technique found 4 prove atomic fusion indeed take place enough explain exces heat generated good indication two socalled law absolute example late physicist dewey b larson developed comprehensive general unified theory physical universe call system describe detail several book nothing motion 1979 universe motion 1984 physical universe ha two distinct half material half antimatter half continuou cycle matter energy passing without heat death predicted law hi theory explain universe much better modern orthodox theory including phenomenon orthodox physicist astronomer still head every way free energy device might energy flow seemingly converting energy energy also certain religiou organization mat teach member physical universe lowest least dozen major level existence like parallel universe analogou tv channel described book like path master dr johnson key secret world paul 1969 example next level physical universe commonly called plane member group learned soul travel higher world report condition seem plausible energy could flow higher level physical universe created boundary given right configuration matter channel thi supported many successful experiment throughout world described book discovery behind iron term economic market ha failed enough money resource fully develop free energy equipment conventional energy desire government needed intervene government intervene total supply energy resource earth continue decline soon run price energy increase pollution harmful effect including effect acid rain radioactive contamination oil rape land strip mining etc continue increase government research development free energy university private production make consumption consumer free energy hardware effect government intervention would widespread quantity energy demanded conventional energy mining oil country electric etc would drop near zero forcing employee seek work elsewhere energy resource uranium oil ga would left ground price conventional energy supply would also drop near zero price free energy equipment would start high drop supply increase happened vcr personal computer etc cost producing product require large quantity energy produce would decrease along price consumer consumer would able realize opportunity cost paying electric utility bill buying home heating fuel would benefit increase would spend money gasoline car government tax revenue gasoline fuel would obtained way energy could longer used motive excuse making war many conventional energy would go busines society whole earth environment would benefit greatly person government serve rather big corporation bank information answer ymy question etc please consult cited source patent article book reproduction thi important information encouraged robert e b physic
