simon subject american evolution free razor inside sorry delay responding due conference paper deadline panic article robert write article simon write amount agreement deleted made statement razor experience physic thank info statistic interesting didnt know follow ymy proof one question two hypothesis h latter complicated definition mean ph complicated isnt fact ph come way around ph g g axiom 0 0 ph sense necessarily complicated h h g may hair im trying say subjective impression complicated something ph hold equality 0 point simple matter show px h px ph x x thu h say h consistent datum say px h px elaborate thi well px px b mean x likely observed b thi imply observing x provide useful information might allow u discriminate respective possibility b difference reduce difference unknown prior probability pa pb px px b pa x k pa pb x k pb k px px px b px b equally consistent datum observing x doesnt give pointer b particular case h b however know prior probability ordered ph although dont know actual value thi allows u razor throw also real world isnt clear cut dry seem cant alway determine whether equality px h px true certainly true particular point wa whether divine component actually prevalence religion addition transmission component even religiou acknowledge talk spreading word seem ive said observed religiou belief well transmission model rather le well one propose divine component addition since would expect latter wide even mutual among belief thu personal feeling px isnt even equal px h thi case smaller h transmission g divine component x among belief happily acknowledge thi subjective impression btw beef ymy argument wa mathematical one checked ymy work didnt find error seem careful probably isnt math mistake think mistake philosophical make sure understand please term think thi reasonable request alway try look way explaining physic im type thi would helpful im either idea theism atheism compatible read observation date however theism type concerned also suggest instance prayer may answered person may principle statistical verification god may generally intervene way thi mean region space possible observation appearance god probability hypothesi zero since much probability available hypothesi around observation space probability theism making appearance god possible must come somewhere else ie possible observation else equal thi mean observation isnt appearance god must slightly higher probability atheism theism stuff imply observation must cause running estimate probability hypothesi increase corresponding decrease running estimate probability hypothesi sorry still bit rather difficult put way since depend property probability density particularly total area alway unity analogy may may helpful say hypothesi coin fair b coin unfair ive used b avoid confusion ph 05 total 1 pt 05 ph b 1 total 1 pt b 0 observation string head tail thi compatible fair coin coin b however probability making possible appearance tail even though dont actually appear must come somewhere else since total must unity come thi case probability appearance head say running estimate time n1 observation time n another head h estimate modified according ph ph ph b ph dont know ph actual prior probability head ea half thi true every time coin tossed head observed thu whatever initial value estimate n head n n since 1 time k show 05 1 thu 1 2 hence estimate hypothesi must decrease trial coin hypothesi b must increase even though hypothesis compatible string head loose analogy unfair coin atheism fair coin theism observation consistent tail would unfair coin analogou appearance god would atheism claiming analogy extend numerical value variou probability principle constant observation evidence god evidence possible respective theism constantly increase estimated probability dont exist important draw distinction theism could supported supported evidence theism cant given theism evidence principle possible doesnt make sense say lack evidence support contrary view quite thi type theism might call g term razor discussion id bin ground depend upon ymy conception thi god conception like happened come earth play quite frequently agree lack evidence thi conception god evidence exist ymy conception god one make prediction see prediction disagree lack evidence support disbelief hypothesis dont indeed model theism isnt used phrase given specific x theism make prediction px ht 0 used word theism make prediction specific event say believe god happen believe god given x never say px ht 0 even say thi set x x thi dont like ymy use probability also way probability hold science criterium someone tell measure even principle px h probability applicable hypothesi h case h ht ha example px ha px measure dont dont need analogy know prior probability updating hypothesi le unity corresponding coin hypothesi greater unity dont need know initial value running estimate either clear large number observation approach zero approach unity need know whether px ha larger px ht observed x thi follow assumption certain event rendered possible necessary ht possible ha else equal statistic rely upon series observation hypothesi isnt observation even statement observation observation relevant sequence observation must chosen care im curiou know type observation mind concerning theism atheism observation like really doesnt matter affect reasoning provided possible observation would count appearance god example thi might demonstration prayer revelation statement px h general x still count prediction h theism question ht say prayer may answered miracle may happen see interpretation quoted god exist mean thi prediction px ht 0 x distinguish atheist hypothesi ha predict thi stuff happen px ha 0 x theism make claim px ht 0 x say theism doesnt maybe wa quick say common language said existence god mean notion deity described bible christian interact universe claimed agent agreed thi however must careful believe thi im making claim maybe changed important shift emphasi way since belief conclude px ht 0 x ok well interact may interact would actually better since interact imply agree dont think theism make prediction maybe im understanding mean prediction could explain mean thi word ill explain bear mind thi isnt central require theism make prediction appearance god never happen atheism somebody point quantum mechanic doesnt make thi prediction either difference atheism form partition prediction include statement prayer implying stat find prayer prayer say unto thi generation shall pa till thing fulfilled dont think problem misunderstanding persistent observation thi stuff happening consistent ht though may consistent ha explained stat post even ht god exist problem argument let number observation go infinity btw consider argument require infinite number observation valid rather part argument valid existing human never make infinite number conclusion thi dont accept valid fine dont claim theism false merely finite number observation available far suggest continue observe suggestion look better better stuff deleted stat post assumed theism wa indeed finite number observation relevant quote important assumption observation compatible theist hypothesi atheist hypothesi thu would atheism called appearance god thi need taken literally observation require explanation one god exist count observation assumed compatible hypothesis thi leaf theism atheism single observation appearance god problem thi something must make prediction x seen x seen hypothesi ha atheism word something theism theism belief atheism disbelief certain atheism certainly certain theism eg theism assert world 6000 year old god thi ha however atheism theism also could wrong thi think appearance god sufficient atheism wherea general corresponding theism ill think general question x also way let x coin fair accurately make sense two side coin different thi tossing coin even string head consistent fair coin go infinite number x limit least one head least one tail appeared thi partly wrong argument require observation made simply observation truth value relation statement god exist use ymy argument understand someone would say since statement god exist make prediction choose believe none le thi would founded type faith dont like word faith insert belief evidence instead ill assume meant god exist highlight agreed definition exist statement make prediction said although isnt finite number observation actually mean god exist make prediction oop sorry truth thi actually depend upon god refering think conception god true im open could wrong give example prediction god exist one think true would healing thi principle never determined one way case person seem recover without help doctor known reason situation fact happen consistent hypothesi way support hypothesi agree inconsistent hypothesi cant think one prediction god exist isnt thi type might missing something happen october 28 1992 said would atheism satisfaction happened although failure happen course theism specifically predicted phenomenon require existence one god explanation ever observed sum whole thing bob
