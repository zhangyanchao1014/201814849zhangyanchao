carefully recorded thi might prime example event added jesus life enhance message church gospel whole story similarity tale infant mosis egypt highly likely device set matthew add prophetic yet artificial approval jesu surprising matthew conveniently mention rest jeremiah quote child prophet speak dead empire gd comfort saying child returned gather back together course thi would suit matthew purpose child speak dead good prophecy matthew set even anyone bother check convincing even go next chapter find another prophecy leaving egypt joseph wife take infant jesu live city mt 223 wa spoken prophet might fulfilled shall called first thing notice matthew mention name prophet thi time second ask prophecy speaking worse prophecy period mentioning still worse mentioned old testament book

jesu wa using time grave friday night time sunday morning could also add little time friday since bible specific thi mean using jewish time wa grave one day two night possibly couple hour one day certainly thi problem jesu prediction absolutely way even able hi death involve three day three night even using modern time measurement led suspect thi error another one matthew little mistake gospel writer put false word hi god mouth matter made prediction hearing understanding jesu tool habit speaking hi vast audience parable story deeper meaning could found already one elect chosen understand message jesu reason understand parable one want person understand need bother since accept plain message better matthew say mt audience indeed fulfilled prophecy isaiah say indeed hear never

hidden since foundation world matthew really attempt quote prophet psalm p open mouth parable utter dark saying old thing heard known thing father told u hide child tell coming generation gloriou deed lord wa pointed verse psalm really come prophet might also want know earlier copy matthew gospel even inserted isaiah name thi prophet apparently later caught error tried cover perhap significant part thi matthew ha altered old testament scripture jesu ha said earlier speak parable understand parable psalm hidden speak thing known father told u jesu deal thing hidden since foundation world indeed jesu dealt lot secrecy confusion thi direct opposition parable psalm wonder matthew rewrite still matthew artificial prophecy fall flat face christian rarely look thi matthew prophecy arent thing christianity beginning look bad excuse little faith mt see disciple able go around demon except one case knowing wa person thought disease demon wonder disciple unable jesu perhap reported saying didnt enough faith thi seem strange wa thi demon special seem either true believer ha faith apparently enough faith allow someone move mountain course find one day move real mountain one part sea miracle speak happen trip mexico place major miracle making old woman feel better sunday morning tv god including jesu alway ancient writing protected skeptic sacred past either dead sleeping hiding heaven person return great miracle day long gone yet life go tale story miracle distant time distant place god used reveal themself man old day jehovah silent theologian give variou excuse dont get

satisfied turning gd everyday sight seeing gd speaking seeing gd way person used see see world good compassion human heart love given taken man woman forgivenes christian atheist alike beauty created mind man thing done see said thi everybody ha little faith jesu ride shortly accepting role jewish messiah king jesu request brought ride jerusalem mt 215 thi took place wa spoken prophet saying tell daughter behold ymy king coming humble mounted course passage quoted 99 read little differently lo ymy king come humble riding colt command peace nation isnt much difference except involf one animal matthew read wording slightly differently thu ha jesu call colt adult matthew version get picture divine christ two thi could inevitably lead theological find account written earlier st mark colt wa called brought jesu thi indeed fit verse properly show u matthew attempt use prophetic verse ha excluding many christian met noticed christ thought situation often reversed nowaday entering jerusalem temple priest person calling jesu messiah jesu replied might expect matthew done mt havent read mouth babe thou ha brought perfect praise likely matthew made thi response since jesu wa never one point little prophetic thing since might expect quote error seem fit matthew track record quite well might ask jesu matthew havent read source read psalm lord ymy name whole world whose glory heaven babe infant founded ymy fo still enemy avenger passage hardly need comment perfect praise spoken psalm praise given gd hi messiah king jesu mentioned seem one case matthew pen making convenient prophetic scripture said lord jesu said asked promised jewish jew agree king david jesu counter quoting psalm 110 lord said lord sit right hand put ymy enemy ymy foot taken face value jesu denying necessity descent one assume opposition answer course christian answer agree trying make hidden point reveal mystery divine nature believe thi one christian interested matter investigation problem jesus time psalm wa thought messiah easy see david might refer messiah hi superior need look scripture messiah see expected great king bringing jew time even better david rule course jew listening good answer passage could indeed refer divine messiah christian worship problem ly meaning thi psalm error apparently several jew jesus time also made one must remember variou among jew often result different expectation jesu wa apparently one like hi audience thought messiah wa interpreted psalm 110 among problem psalm 110 literally read lord sit right hand make ymy enemy ymy send forth ymy mighty rule midst ymy fo ymy person offer themself freely day lead ymy host holy mountain priest order forever word lord often christian bible denote divinity thi lord hebrew word exist simply mean lord generic term would use used often scripture refer king gd merely addres respect nothing text imply word refer either divinity thi supposed written david certain title psalm translate either psalm david psalm david seem fitting assume written court david covenant gd psalm written david unlikely would talking messiah idea perfect king david wa present david age extensive tale david saying none include praise messiah many psalm show evidence written long david wa dead time gd put hi show favmy david kingdom hold description psalm fit david well david wa promised gd rise power victory hi enemy successful judgement among nation achieved priesthood common righteou king enabled bles person fit blame thi problem matthew alone though artificial prophecy though hi use scripture rather questionable still thi event common gospel let matthew little easily thi time interesting note though matthew event earlier gospel mark tell tale jesu simply speaking crowd matthew ha pharisee became religiou competition infant christianity target jesus question might expect matthew write event end pharisee power pen mosis jesu together along leave gospel story matthew see john gospel gospel story john deserve special treatment seem far removed real event jesus career told even matthew moment look one verse early church leader founded religion jewish hope messiah king artificial extension original promise made gd constructing history abraham mosis wrote promise land jewish person thi wa accomplished eventually rule king david christian came along later decided would claim promise expanded promise preaching kingdom john jc speaking ymy father abraham see day say wa glad would nice tie approval jesu abraham abraham knew nothing jesu messiah anything christian tried failed find event old testament correspond john little prophecy course see st john making old testament backing like hi matthew many christian know faith ha many foundation fraud surprising still field told jesu wa jerusalem one hi follower juda matthew write mt throwing piece silver temple juda chief priest taking silver said isnt u put treasury since blood money bought field bury stranger wa fulfilled wa spoken prophet jeremiah took thirty piece silver price price set son israel gave field lord directed thi prophecy utterly gros old testament scripture first matthew ha made mistake regarding name prophet utter verse matthew make use wage thirty silver said cast treasury price wa paid took thirty silver cast treasury house first verse deal messiah gd deal shepherd likely priest chosen serve function person shortly gd would send israel conflict one another word treasury replaced king jame scholar precisely thi made matthew quote fit better thi blatant error correct translation hebrew indeed treasury also make perfect sense context wherea field totally whether wa intentional seem beyond speculation however given matthew track record one find hard resist notion intentional course matthew would ample reason text thirty piece silver match juda situation christian seem reader willing disregard matthew might another prophecy tos around however correct translation directly contradict situation juda high priest high priest would put money treasury worthles shepherd exactly opposite course average bible student prophecy presented matthew would taken new testament face value matthew work convincing enough lot jesu led away mt gave drink would drink divided hi among lot might fulfilled wa spoken prophet among upon cast lot first offered jesu actually common type roman soldier regularly find right jesu dy soldier themself give drink jesu said stood put full held hi mouth received said finished matthew seem drawing passage prophet one psalm p looked pity wa none found none gave poison food lit put meat gave drink add punishment upon punishment may thee let book living course offered jesu done hi request drink thi indeed seem show pity psalm quoted david hi political military enemy messiah jesu surprising run problem see jesu psalm ask gd damnation wherea jesu gospel say jesu said father forgive dont know matthew hi attempt create prophecy substance put jesus drink hi meat psalm prophecy faulty naturally ask lot thi bring psalm deserve discussion suffice say fact jesus clothe divided told great thing turn thi happened often day soon see perhap least passage psalm applied jesu indeed bring interesting question quality jesus clothe man removed possession hi ownership clothe worthy lot raise suspicion psalm thi psalm attributed david hi condition attack hi enemy become song praise hope taken context part seem fit jesu quite well examine primary passage verse 12 god god far helping far word oh god cry day dont answer night find rest jesu said cried first sentence cro thi suggest whole psalm really jesu rather king david course rest first fit nicely jesu hi execution jesu complaining whole supposed like lamb led indeed jesu doesnt much even cro certainly cry day night cro 68 worm man man see make face head committed hi cause let deliver thi seem fit jesus execution pretty well exception holy messiah called worm many bull open mouth widely like lion yea dog round company hand foot see bone divide among cast lost far away deliver soul sword life power dog save mouth lion soul horn wild bull would seem quite convincing im sure early christian father wrote thi prophecy thought unfortunately thi prophecy ha fatal flaw word really exist psalm correct hebrew translation 16 yea dog round company like lion hand foot hebrew phrase like lion rare form mean differ one character word hebrew text literally like lion make sense context even fit animal employed psalm writer convenience would urge christian change word add needed yet artificial weight prophecy thi christian translator chosen correct translation eliminate psalm referring jesu absence say much translator apart verse 16 psalm lend jesu easily verse 20 speak saved sword rather cro thi naturally fit psalm true subject king david side note know hand palm rather thi doesnt say much favmy traditional thought jesu showing hi disciple hi palm fact arent bound religiou belief matthew escape thi time attempt draw many direct link thi psalm hi lord jesu psalm like many wa mind gospel writer compiled story interpretation jesus life death much scripture may contributed actually got written question ha seriou christian theology easy see faithful fundamentalist event new testament might enhanced eager matthew le speculate simply investigate scriptural matter prophetic claim far thi ha said good thing st matthew reference look lot like jesus john gospel written 70 year fact tell u jesus execution one soldier hi side came blood water thing took place scripture fulfilled look theyve course thi built passage taken context prophet tell u much nation israel split jerusalem go war give victory day seek destroy nation come jerusalem pmy spirit compassion jerusalem look like child john attempt make prophecy perhap matthew attempt matthew least usually one passage john error obviou blatant speak well gospel writer help show prophetic aspect religion founded hi arrest jesu quickly executed claiming jewish according one version gospel tale jesu get executed along two mk two one hi right one hi left scripture wa fulfilled say wa mark trying link jesu passage isaiah 53 servant nation israel passage messiah one read whole chapter isaiah 53 surrounding chapter one see servant nation verse also thi servant ha gone past prediction come event servant thought criminal thi also happen fit description jesu passage really messiah still clear jesu two would fulfill prophecy isaiah jesu would fulfill hi whole ministry wa considered throughout hi career locking onto single event rather poor way steal prophecy least thi case see mark could made better analogy general comparison mark go tell u jesu also thi expected couple course hi later st luke decide change thing luke tell u one criminal wa hanged arent messiah save u thi certainly fit mark tell person jesu said save luke go criminal first saying dont fear gd since sentence condemnation indeed receiving due reward deed thi man ha done nothing wrong said jesu remember come ymy kingdom jesu answered say today paradise thi little dialogue seem highly stretch imagination bit see thi picture one hi fellow criminal speech rather strange picture criminal goodnes hi punishment hi suffering man apparently noble principle doesnt seem likely wonder amount created luke course luke also disagree mark luke ha one criminal jesu easy enough discount account wa made wish believe part error free word gd thi avenue open thi yet another example writer trying take old testament passage expand suit hi theology thi case create problem seen end world mt 24 come perhap one extraordinary passage new testament found three gospel story cast doubt whole theory christianity jesu mention destruction jewish temple building hi disciple ask thi end world ha warning disciple tell u thi temple destruction sign ymy coming close age jesu take care one lead many come name saying christ hear war rumour war thi must take place end yet nation rise nation thi beginning deliver put death false prophet arise lead many end saved thi gospel preached throughout whole world testimony nation end come see spoken prophet daniel let flee mountain immediately day sun star fall heaven appear sign son man heaven tribe earth see son man coming send hi angel gather hi elect learn lesson tree soon branch become put forth leaf know summer near also see thing know near gate truly say thi generation pa away thing take place day hmy one know angel son father therefore also must ready son man coming hmy expect thi clear jesu thought world would within lifetime least hi disciple tell although doesnt know exact day hmy come thu must ready theologian wet pant panic find way thi holy error unfortunately jesu made explicit told hi disciple generation would still around end particular prepare prepare away removing nature bible said phrase thi generation shall pa away really mean thi race person pa away course word generation used many time refer exactly generation disciple interesting notion god decided learn greek didnt learn well enough make clear quite obviou rest dialogue disciple least supposed live end world charge completely blown away looking apostle response become clear rev 1 peter 47 1 john rev jesu meant exactly said end wa near 2000 year christian thi 24th chapter matthew ignored meaning altogether 2000 year waited executed leader come back hearing war rumour war sure coming soon surely must must wait imagine tired must sitting around holy waiting right moment spring shortly hi jesu died said three day three day three night three period time three eternal second three whatever decide make le trouble wa seen divine decided wasnt best interest hi new religion stick around therefore disappeared sight heaven story go anyway ha seen many thing attributed jesu person got around writing gospel story jesu wa prophecy scripture seen though thi matter quite throughout church history christian held fast faith simple belief doctrinal objection could solved brute force faith kept away question question investigate ha never easiest way treat matter thu 2000 year prophecy cited new testament gone largely accepted thing may well continue way time moment consider way doctrine christianity accepted used properly support war persecution suppose one prophecy christianity keep hold mt jesu dont think come bring peace earth havent come bring peace rather sword
