petrus pihko subject concerning god morality long thi kind argument cry comment jbrownbatmanbmdtrwcom wrote article scott write jim originally wrote god create disease responsible god create wa life according protein code evolve without deep discussion v god created original genetic code perfect without flaw evidence thi code wa perfect ha ever since evidence favmy thi statement shouldnt perhap biggest code full region called intervene coding region impressive amount evidence suggest ancient origin likely early represented early protein domain number increasing appear los occur specie common usually quite similar structure gene hand possibility inserted later present several logical difficulty removed mechanism thi would present inserted moreover insertion would required precise random insertion would since sequence removal beside sequence usually leaf trace long terminal repeat target site found near sequence seriously recommend reading textbook molecular biology genetic posting theological argument like thi try watson molecular biology gene baltimore molecular biology cell starter remember question wa posed theological context god cause disease answer likewise theological perspective le valid purely scientific perspective different scientific perspective supported evidence wherea theological perspective often fail thi criterion think meaning said god made genetic code perfect doesnt mean perfect ha certainly evolved since worse would please cite reference support ymy assertion ymy assertion le valid scientific perspective unles support evidence fact ha claimed disease perhap important weve thought instance sex might evolved defence thi view supported computer simulation evolution eg perhap thought wa higher energy ray like xray gamma ray cosmic ray caused damage fact thermal energy damage although usually mild easily fixed action actually neither u know atmosphere wa like time god created life according claim life began 4 billion year ago would half billion year earth wa created would still primitive support life seem remember figure like 25 3 billion year ago life earth anyone better estimate id replace created formed since need invoke creator earth formed without one recent estimate age earth range 46 48 billion year earliest sign life true fossil organic layer date back 35 billion year thi would leave billion year first cell evolve im sorry cant give reference thi based course evolutionary biochemistry attended wa great satan engineer disease genetic although force natural selection tend improve specie genetic code tend offset thi want thi true evidence thi supposed understand scott reaction excuse thi know must know know point know everything come response ymy last statement neither may well believe accept fact know hope dont forget thi evidence suggest everything come evidence thi conclusion science one believe anything healthy sign doubt right path walk take look evidence present one conclusion prior thi theology use thi method therefore seriously doubt could ever come right conclusion human dna complex tend error affecting ability fight disease simpler dna bacterium viruse tend become efficient causing infection disease bad combination hence suffer genetic purpose valid move bacterium viruse exist cause disease another manifest general principle evolution save efficient method dna survive le efficient method didnt make present last time please present evidence ymy claim human dna evolutionary process person claimed opposite true suppressed selection thu bound degrade havent seen much evidence either claim ask thi relevant discussion answering john question genetic disease many disease require baby develop antibody god fault original question say course nothing evil god fault ymy explanation work fail may right fact dont know satan responsible neither suppose powerful evil like satan exist would might responsible many ill affect mankind dont think could done much better job pun intended problem seem satan necessary explain disease inevitable product evolution say seem like another bad inference actually youve done said point ymy summary word take new context never said person meant presumably god punished getting disease say free moral choice consequence mankind choose reject god person done since beginning expect god protect event universe expecting thi god exist expect leave u alone would also like hear believe ymy choice indeed free thi interesting philosophical question answer seem consequence would expect rejecting allah oh admit perfect yet im working good library bookstore good starting point thi price tea china question provided answer biology genetic fine subject important scientific explain god created set life process dont explain behind creation life subsequent evolution behind ymy proposition wa something supported evidence thi recommend book need invoke behind prime evidence thi whole universe come existence without intervention recent theory hawking et al suggest person still insist thi thank ymy fine advice highly motivated learn detail biology genetic although im sure id find fascinating subject realize detail change big picture god created life beginning ability change environment im sorry evidence ymy big picture need create anything capable come existence without supreme try reading creation freeman 1992 petrus petrus pihko
