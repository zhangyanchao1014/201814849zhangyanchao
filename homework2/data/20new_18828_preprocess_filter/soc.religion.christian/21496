herein christian justify homosexual given bible say first definition homosexual many group believe homosexual orientation ie sexual attraction member sex thi actual homosexual sexual activity homosexual sex considered group acceptable however lot discussion term homosexual mean someone actually homosexual sex thi generally accepted outside liberal group thi paper im going use homosexual meaning person sexual act another sex havent heard biblical argument person homosexual orientation remain think person admit homosexual thi often called homosexual orientation known whether genetic environmental evidence suggesting best evidence ive seen homosexuality single phenomenon ha number different cause one probably genetic several group try help person move homosexual heterosexual exodu international report ive seen havent read detailed literature summary minority opinion presbyterian church infamou report human sexuality suggest program low succes rate question real even certainly person say converted however thi issue important sound believe homosexuality wrong believe intrinsically wrong defined god fact hard get homosexual relevant fact hard escape drug addict wrong wrong may affect deal person though difficult change thi may tend make u willing forgive one general background issue common quote figure 10 population homosexual asked one expert thi came hi response kinsey see source figure 10 percent define sexuality behavior orientation person scale zero completely heterosexual 6 completely heterosexual according kinsey male adult least one experience post ten

subject sex u moral condition lc card thi figure widely used scholarly discussion ha even found hold true several culture noted recent thi child gay feb 24 1992 journalist running round talk show thi season promoting book allegedly refute kinsey study scholarly world seem take ive seen objection kinsey study enough detail include someone would like contribute another view id willing include christian believe homosexuality least sex wrong however denomination accept community church wa formed specifically accept homosexual however united church christ also allows think couple group may well church seem accept area church government youll find congregation accept even among southern baptist though number probably one two congregation unusual church permit homosexual church leader carefully enforce thi another issue dont doubt homosexual pastor every denomination open argument biblical issue attempt summarize issue commonly cited reference acceptance homosexuality previou discussion ha john boswell christianity social tolerance homosexuality u chicago pres 1980 argument pretty clear several explicit law ot eg leviticu rom 1 paul seem pretty negative homosexuality beyond reference debate passage often cited subject probably relevant eg sin inhabitant sodom proposed carry wa homosexual rape homosexual activity adult even question whether wa homosexual since entity involved angel wa particularly involved guest responsibility toward guest culture wa strong thi probably reason lot offered hi daughter wa better give hi daughter allow hi guest attacked look reference sodom elsewhere bible youll see seem imply homosexuality wa sin jewish tradition major sin wa abuse guest rate debate homosexual rape wrong discus leviticu law part set law christian consider binding unles nt justification found lev alone would settle issue nt reference paul letter number reference paul list sin word fairly vague boswell argue word occuring list mean homosexual say two greek word appear list ie cor 69 tim 110 arsenokoitai unfortunately entirely clear word actually mean basic meaning soft ha variety meaning ethical writing boswell suggest likely equivalent also report interpretation church including christian wa thi passage referred meaning ha 20th cent practice ha come le cite reference late 1967 edition catholic encyclopedium identify translate male prostitute giving evidence none church father understood term referring homosexuality general technical meaning suggested early latin translation would active mode homosexual male prostitute hi view paul intend technically conservative view consulted gordon fee commentary cor cite evidence often meant however boswell warn u greek culture necessarily homosexual though may associated kind homosexual behavior given boswell fee say taken together suspect term simply definite apply homosexual case isnt general term homosexuality fee argue boswell well end suggesting translation seem essentially big problem word almost never used paul writing first fact word clearly composed male unfortunately doesnt quite tell u meaning since doesnt tell u whether male subject object action example compound word formed either way given theory could refer etc dangerou base meaning purely youll conclude religiou expression based god ye however since boswell fee seem agree homosexual male prostitute seem good gues note thi translation strong term however something fee boswell agree attempt reproduce translation opinion strongest nt reference homosexuality roman 1 boswell point rom 1 speak homosexuality something happened person naturally heterosexual result corruption due false god one could argue thi simply example homosexual false god would also fall degradation perhap become heterosexual however find thi argument somewhat forced fact homosexual reader seriously proposed thi paul meant however convinced rom 1 sufficient create law homosexuality christian paul describing rom 1 homosexuality among christian homosexuality appeared among one part whole package despite impression left hi rhetoric im sure paul believe pagan completely abandoned heterosexual sex given hi description situation rather assume heterosexual sex would also ye believe thi passage indicate negative view homosexuality nature act reflection general spiritual state person specific feature homosexuality overall view situation following think enough evidence confident paul homosexuality rom 1 seem clear cor 69 tim 110 general condemnation homosexuality seem like wording would come someone approved homosexuality even considered acceptable case hand none passage contain explicit teaching subject rom 1 really refer homosexuality passing result thi situation person interpret passage light general approach scripture look scripture law issue thi surprising would consider passage nt ot prohibition whose approach bible liberal surprising regard paul negative view homosexuality something took hi jewish without seriou light gospel reader thi group know assumption behind approach different person tend foam mouth see opposing view described lot moderator situation number discussion past around sort detailed text described however fact im convinced defender homosexuality actually base belief real issue seem rest question whether paul judgement apply modern homosexuality one commonly made claim paul simply never faced kind question trying deal encountered homosexuality context person would probably agree wa wrong never faced experience christian try act straight fail never faced christian trying define christian homosexuality fit general christian ideal seeing sexuality mirror relationship god man unfair take paul judgement homosexuality among use make judgement question another following paul time homosexuality wa associated number thing christian would find acceptable wa part temple among private citizen often occured adult child free person slave im position say alway reason think ancient active passive partner wa considered free adult act passive partner thi reason active mode homosexual prostitute would considered hi customer would person enjoyed passive role thi support idea would tend engaged two free adult male least without degree clearly christian homosexual would condone sex child slave position fully responsible partner however fee commentary cor cite example ancient literature homosexual relationship seem involve free adult reasonably way thu consideration thi paragraph shouldnt pushed far homosexuality may jew association surely must case prostitute involve slave child person argued aid judgement homosexuality id like point aid transmitted promiscuou sex homosexual heterosexual someone ha homosexual relationship meet christian criterium marriage risk aid note good reason paul general approach doubt would homosexuality fully equal alternative apart specific statement homosexuality believe hi use genesi story would lead regard heterosexual marriage god however way paul deal question provide warning quick deal thi issue legally claim question counsel homosexual christian entirely theological issue also one paul tendency see issue eating meat holiday principle issue look carefully good person involved avoid insisting would personally damaging example paul clearly believed wa acceptable eat meat wanted u avoid pushing person action personal another example paul obviously would preferred see person least circumstance remain yet unable certainly would rather see married state might tempted believe one could take view like thi even accepting view paul expressed rom 1 one may believe homosexuality god intended occured result sin still conclude time live note creation story work enter human life result sin thi doesnt mean christian stop working saved question whether believe homosexuality sinful whether believe broad sense due human youre willing consider latter approach become judgement whether damage caused finding way live trying cure danger trying cure attempt often fail end damage ranging psychological damage suicide well broken marriage attempt living heterosexual fail thi going depend upon one assessment inherent nature homosexuality believe seriou wrong may willing run high risk seriou damage get rid clearly generally suggest person live tendency steal drug even though attempt cure condition also difficult however condition intrinsically damaging way obviou homosexuality many problem associated homosexuality actually problem promiscuity homosexuality thi include aid take granted sort homosexual relationship christian would consider allowing would equivalent christian heterosexual relationship course discussing thi last decade weve heard lot personal testimony fellow christian thi situation ive also seen summary variou research result variou effort conversion aside presbyterian report mentioned faq summarize reader report thi question evidence longterm succes changing orientation rare enough healing miracle danger christian depend upon change clear conversion doesnt happen almost alway person often left feeling excluded church ha nothing say requirement paul recognized though different context demand practical person think history ha strongly judgement practical result homosexual end gay sex club rest side homosexuality maybe homosexuality isnt god original ideal well imagine paul see person longterm committed christian relationship promiscuity work genesi suggest wasnt part god original ideal either think relationship still vehicle person sharing god love issue biblical interpretation underlying thi discussion issue cultural relativism paul say something wrong thi taken eternal statement thing wrong specific situation culture time conservative christian generally insist taking prohibition absolute since otherwise bible become subjective stop u considering everything relative looking thi issue worth noting one completely reject concept cultural relativism number judgement new testament even conservative christian consider relative following judgement least clear bible anything said homosexuality prohibition charging interest thi occur 18 time ot nt mention relatively recently church consider binding christian prohibition oath slavery institution judgement tax collector sinner regard item binding case believe argument essentially one cultural relativism briefly prohibition interest appropriate specific society bible wa trying build market economy person believe american judicial oath characteristic kind oath jesu wa concerned person believe paul wa simply telling person live within slavery institution person believe ir morally equivalent roman tax point im trying make applying biblical prohibition 20th cent need look whether 20th cent action christian homosexual say relationship different greek homosexuality paul would familiar thi exactly kind argument made judicial oath tax collector fairly recently christian prohibited taking interest many christian regarded slavery endorsed indeed slavery one common metaphor relationship god human christian often called servant slave god trying say everything bible relative rather im trying say thing therefore enough say something appear bible end discussion need look whether action talking ha moral implication one bible wa talking christian want argue reason think prohibition homosexuality still binding im willing listen claim question doesnt need looked kidding themself unles part small minority really obey rule listed one thing worry great emotion thi issue create consider weaknes biblical evidence law leviticu passage rom whose subject matter really rather homosexuality couple list whose word amount concern thi raising among christian seem rather proportion thi suggest person reason simply biblical involved thi true side clearly homosexual christian strongly motivated find way biblical argument conservative christian find biblical argument cant help feeling bible used side way attitude come source thi dangerou situation christian side issue would like note problem position commonly presented one common argument homosexuality determined ie god made homosexual choice think god made homosexual fine view person already believe ground homosexuality acceptable dont see argument many person think largely biological drug may turn well doesnt mean ok u particular thing tend wrong person get angry easily tend arrogant tend woman married someone else homosexuality view wrong wouldnt different thing going follow god end one time another work overcome bad habit particular cause u problem none u sit back say god made u way jesu said take cro daily thi concept dying self also appear throughout paul letter seem suggest going thing ourself called accept paul letter experience christian throughout history show u sin u battle difficult fact homosexuality difficult fight doesnt necessarily say ok maybe thi isnt place die self id like make sure think isnt fighting battle somewhere else rejecting concept christian fight deeply habit sin
