robert j subject procomm plu window problem kent p write normal procomm plu ive considering buying window got really great review computer shopper friend connect mainframe unix machine using screen seem problem keeping ha modem 486 50 mhz machine cant see trouble keeping hi work great high speed modem edition 01 apr 93 thi article apply window 30 31 nt os2 app running window one limitation current window pc serial com performance seriously almost everyone purchase highspeed modem v32bi v32 hst discover problem first time try download file accept incoming fax 9600 upgrading modem error even active application fax program transfer complete may take even longer old modem three reason problem 1 universal asynchronou uart used pc primitive device buffer operating read flush character high interrupt rate next incoming character previou one lost fairly environment usually keep window cant 2 window ha operating system overhead plain interrupt often take longer service much likely soon report ymy vendor losing datum may advised need upgrade 16550 likely since seem conspiracy ignorance thi issue youll get useful advice mailorder source spoke attempting solve problem never heard term 16550 many didnt even know uart wa 3 even ymy pc ha uart ps2 upgrade ymy board add new com board may still experience error standard microsoft window com driver dont take full advantage 16550 window 31 improved thi regard 30 still recommend driver upgrade application like use get around thi problem themself modem card may problem modem part card designed aware state uart avoid however wouldnt want bet card designer clever insist 16550 uart ever buy modem card modem card dont even conventional uart work standard window driver need one use see modem card hardware situation uart pc com port based national semiconductor chip inside chip cant replace id uart type ymy system running microsoft diagnostic program sure run bringing window window serial apus may prevent accurately identifying 16550 run window prompt uart ha separate transmit receive trigger level run reliably clock rate bp although current modem technology point pushing ymy luck going bp 16550 ha acces cycle time 16550 also ha dma capability clear pc driver ever use thi technical info see national semiconductor application note uart component try locate uart ymy mother board io card com board modem card cant find component number ymy com port probably buried wont able perform chip replacement disable ymy com port chose least add aftermarket com board one chip buy low power cmo version ic several supplier typically 9 15 n chip normal package style available avoid chip without presumably ok early n chip bug although national exchange manufacture free clone chip available variou ic maker national manual driver state support following apparently equivalent chip national semiconductor texa instrument silicon system warn western digital say problem reported early ibm ps2 70 system ibm upgrade dont chip youll need buy market com board thi modem card situation may add new com card youll need either disable port replacing although watch irq conflict without although cheaper card

builtin port however driver could set internal com3 4 using irq sharing software situation simply upgrading 16550 uart completely solve common problem standard serial driver dont take full advantage 16550 window 30 driver even le capable window 31 driver following limitation enable receive rate 2400 bp never enable transmit result interrupt rate upload set trigger level 14 byte high easy 2 byte arrive driver read port menu control panel allows speed v32bi modem datum text easily compres 31 suggesting host connect rate bp would effective apus wont accept rate apus wont let program know 16550 even program arent get little benefit 16550 port standard driver dont allow irq sharing bio doesnt properly many system window provide workaround app dont provide port speed option bp problem solved window nt 60 may may addressed window release 31 40 rumor suggest may solved window 40 get replacement driver solve problem buying copy current version 12 research pacific division 180 beacon hill lane 503 voice 503 fax 503 bb compuserve price wa around 50 recall set accept credit card send check list far know dont stock bio software company per se apparently needed reliable serial connection instrument application wrote driver discovered market revised general purpose com driver suite recently upgraded window 31 runtime licensed host connect rate set bp app zero problem download routinely see transfer rate exceed 2000 bp also using bp pc lossles io upload variou remote system another matter many host still using uart driver note still highest rate window 31 port menu control panel allow com port get around thi allowing specify port factor set real uart rate multiple rate passed window dialog box also hardware flow control enabled suggest even ever transfer ascius datum sufficiently reliable method flow control dec standard sender may transmit another 16 ye byte receipt receiving system device 16 byte 16550 clearly big enough let u rely exclusively engineer ha informed 16550 cant really environment using datum rate may still risky even hardware flow control 16550 still experience busy system lot app running seriou swapping progress thi ymy situation may need buy com board thi cost upgrade review two board review found issue window source magazine suggest trying upgrade first experiment proces priority time power user whose system still run comm problem closing comment state serial support acros computer industry oldest standard io interface job designing hardware writing software often seem assigned least senior lowest engineer computer company design average serial port least ten year behind state art last job major workstation vendor improved serial port initial design new system family machine wa introduced 16550 port however thi exception computer company seem champion decent io may well learn serial io thi situation show sign improving soon expect cry outrage window user worldwide whose pc sort work today v32 fail without uart like 16550 without software driver use uart best advantage modem waste money regard east harmony road bob suite 503 internet fort collin co compuserve 303 copyright 1993 robert j right reserved
