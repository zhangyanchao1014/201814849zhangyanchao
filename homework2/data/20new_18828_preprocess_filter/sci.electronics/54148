bob myer subject switching p question anyway ive built basic converter pretty good result 80 efficiency im running problem try design build anything put seriou amp know done gut bench something puzzle im using simple choke storage element single commercial model use transformer many seem use usual seem loose better anyone full schematic one could get copy id love see manage squeeze much low volume commercial use magnetic energy storage handled big cap primary side power supply would considered filter cap coming right bridge transformer transformer primarily step voltage although seen switch transistor primary side anyone said transistor either failing get one high enough breakdown voltage include diode acros would tell actually many transistor intended use today diode built basic power supply operate something like thi somewhat manner ac line produce high voltage dc rail energy storage filter cap appear acros thi rail switching transistor transistor current primary side transformer resulting pulse secondary least one transformer output fed back control circuit switching transistor act fashion control varying pulse width amount energy dumped primary therefore voltage coming secondary remaining output may allowed simply run whatever value tracking regulated output may additional linear regulation added may also note feedback regulated output control typically ic done vium direct electrical connection thi due variou safety standard require primary secondary circuit isolated often feedback path involf meet thi requirement transformer isnt primary device design thi mean energy stored transformer ignored beside inductive kick giving switch transistor bad time noted also need worry getting energy went transformer back one way another design thi happen le automatically need take special care ensure transformer core doesnt would result best left imagination im stretch imagination designer hopefully real one come along soon clean gros error bob myer hewlettpackard co opinion expressed system technology div employer fort collin colorado thi planet
