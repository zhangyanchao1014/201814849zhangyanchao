paul subject analog article michael write trying build synchronou ive hit application want able change gain op amp amplifier 1 1 vium digital input obviou way ive come use analog switch adjust gain op amp analog switch experience unfortunately want switch ac signal go 5v 5v positive signal carrier signal vary 5v want input signal feeding input signal thru amp gain 1 carrier 5v thru amp gain 1 carrier output low pa believe thi called lock detection well synchronou look thi triple analog positive negative power supply run supply well dual supply logic input still range ground 0 volt thi neat well think design amplifier input output control x analog switch resistor analog switch closed amp switch open clean circuit trim input offset current thi hurt balance thi would show carrier high frequency might cause problem especially isnt usually isnt paul ca usa used think wa im sure
