tony stewart subject voltage regulation current limiting andy collin write one question throw guy clas project need design build power supply following spec adjustable current limited voltage must stay within 2 designated value ac le 5 mv rm course cant use adjustable voltage regulator chip problem current limiting ie weve found stuff rest part circuit supply must presented load would draw given supply voltage reduce voltage current equal one amp thu short thing read one amp measure current 1 ohm resistor read one amp output voltage necessity must basic idea seen current involf circuit pull current base output power transistor therefore reduce output anybody idea could work thank advance andy collin p anybody want flame thi stupid project agree fully still design current limit even like want current limit ymy lead correct pull bia series regulator base drive order get brick wall need enough voltage gain current sensor normally current sensing resistor adequate infinite gain use op amp sense current stable voltage reference use driver turn base bia transistor phase compensation may necessary thi closed loop control system 180 degree phase shift ymy circuit unity gain ok mind bb winnipeg 204
