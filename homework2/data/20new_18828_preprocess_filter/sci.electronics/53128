eric h taylor subject hole practical question wa philosophical question article jim carr write agree come thi nuclear physic one often discus certain reaction effect applying annihilation operator creating hole subtle question longer one work real become also raise sort question real entity phenomenon certainly real one ok ive asked thi new thread line ask thi 1 large hole current run thru resistor r cooling instead heating 2 anyone design amplifier hole current normal electron current 3 semiconductor material highest ratio hole electron please quote actual test sample rather estimate based theory also dont limited semiconductor consider also resistor conductor metal etc note summarize thi thread ha far stated area hole vacuum hole particle exist presence matter previou thread stated hole exist certain semiconductor question naturally arise hole current inside semiconductor point semiconductor joined conductor say copper dont want theoretical discussion whether hole could exist inside metal conductor rather ask experimental discussion detect current exist also note crossposted thi since thi becoming electronic discussion thanx eric et force nature
