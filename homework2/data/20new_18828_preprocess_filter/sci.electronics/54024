jack subject radio used measure distance article tom gardner write robert g carpenter write im wondering possible use radio wave measure distance transmitter receiver ye called radar well actually quite radar measure distance measuring time required transmit signal receive reflection target radar generally use pulse radio use either pulse transmission case latter highly accurate distance measurement made example original radio wa accurate 18 foot 2500 foot altitude note however thi different method measuring poster originally asked problem gaining accurate measurement transmitter seperate receiver need highly accurate time base start receiver exact instant transmitter trigger thi wire connected since radio wave actually travel faster air thi case wire difference called velocity factor cable need resort common automatically corrected distance etc something like connected gp receiver trick transmitter receiver simultaneously sound expensive bad plan spending buck equipment effort go different method use system reflection time measured try thi sound like something pe know anyway seem able measure signal strength determine distance thi would short distance 2000 ft would need accuracy 6 inch thi actually highly inaccurate since power output transmitter vary unit unit antenna transmission line receiver may also vary unit unit unit time would need continuously entire system radio thi also done since everything located one place much easier note especially time base ra receiver transmitter one unit also depend environment static ye dynamic environment object moving kill thi concept nope fm capture effect say strongest signal win unles two signal 3 db signal strength thi one problem make inaccurate low altitude signal tend strong frequency would best thi matter high possible eliminate outside influence also enhance signal radio typically use frequency around 4 hope thi help jack ham radio internet
