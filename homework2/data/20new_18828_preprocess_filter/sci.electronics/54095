tony stewart subject making odd resistor value required filter ian write constructing active filter odd value resistor often required ie something like k ohm seem best choose common capacitor value cope strange resistance demanded pd program work best make resistance given fixed resistor standard 12 value per etc common enough problem yet cant recall program tell gife starting q finding prefered value xy z cheer ian h trying choose resistor tolerance better 1 need screen device cant made adding 2 1 value parallel since smaller device error 1 cope 3 choice live error 1 tolerance device low q circuit low sensitivity design b buy resistor better 1 tolerance c use mind bb winnipeg 204
