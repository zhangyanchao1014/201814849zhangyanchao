steve subject need help video detection circuit trying build circuit detect presence video v blank screen monitoring b output graphic card able detect presence single pixel 65 mhz would mean detecting 15 n pulse also able tell difference blank screen 300 mv dim screen say around 310 mv oh ye also need cheap first circuit wa failure used 3 input going one gun input went reference created voltage first problem wa wa way slow needed get several pixel row would fire could whole screen full text circuit would detect second problem wa noise reference smallest difference blank screen dim screen fact difference completely black completely white 650 mv wondering going video signal make thi work faster expensive require split supply would need replace 49 three 189 create whole new power supply circuit thi point think need sort transistor circuit transistor fast cheap trick unfortunately way league come designing transistor circuit net help idea tip circuit pointer reference etc would greatly appreciated oh ye sample output thi thing every second dont need fast response time however havent found way take advantage fact thank lot help anybody might able give course steve steve midi
