jeff subject digital work alexander wrote hello let introduce problem measure wave voltage digital using ac mode output rm value peak value 2 right measure square wave mode ac output equal peak value actually upper flat boundary wave assumed digital make kind integration input value divide wave period right used measure square wave distorted ideally output output value wa 10 previou one nature thi output value actually measure show rm reading unles say measuring rm probably average voltage input diode measured dc say rm measure measuring average correction true wave ie want correct rm need literally calculation either analog digital circuitry related question le important advantage disadvantage digital compare analog one last significant advantage analog imo wa able see signal wa changing time eg checking capacitor anymore etc duplicate thi thank ymy attention could mail ymy opinion open discussion would appreciate either way alexander v power system laboratory phone office department electrical engineering phone home texa university fax college station tx usa internet jeff semiconductor test equipment system engineer hewlettpackard 415
