subject grounding power wiring wa question outlet wiring ha quite bit discussion house wiring grounding practice point need equipment grounding conductor green green yellow bare metal pipe wiring method used safety ground carry fault current back circuit breaker panel limit voltage metal case equipment metal object never except exception discussed later carry normal operating current connected load equipment ha filter power supply may cause slight current flow grounding conductor much communication audio equipment sensitive noise slight voltage grounding conductor may require special wiring grounding conductor provide reliable operation orange outlet often used thi grounding conductor wired back panel box many case back service anyone installing system read section grounding national electric code publication installing quiet isolated ground system code require grounding conductor green wire run current carrying conductor back panel box required back way service entrance service ground water pipe rod many system installed illegally provide safe ground quiet ground either grounded conductor circuit often called neutral referred code identified conductor supposed white natural grey thi conductor supposed connected ground electrical system single point generally service entrance panel thi connection main jumper many household service panel main jumper actually screw attach neutral case panel grounded conductor neutral generally current carrying conductor case 120 volt circuit one two conductor circuit panel load device since grounded conductor neutral connected grounding conductor bare green service entrance load distance service draw significant current small voltage grounded grounding conductor load normal operating condition connect grounded neutral conductor grounding conductor load neutral current flow instead grounding conductor since current flowing grounding conductor also longer quite ground potential load end load equipment ha metal case connected grounding conductor u ground plug metal case also longer quite ground potential difference normal non condition may volt could also volt two thi normally present shock hazard however let metal case grounded equipment come contact independently grounded object water ga pipe radiator metal air conditioning part neutral current try flow thi ground path contact solid get significant arc low voltage possibly moderate current arc wrong condition thi could start fire possible case ground current could also flow wire inadequate size causing incorrect non grounding neutral short circuit hot neutral high short circuit current may flow cause much higher voltage grounding conductor increase possibility shock fire also connect neutral ground voltage ground system seen noise bu computer audio equipment often causing spent hour tracking short technical facility severe equipment neutral usually ground distribution transformer well service entrance thi done primarily lightning protection lightning current short path back ground also assure current drawn short grounded object like pipe draw enough current trip circuit breaker blow fuse quickly bad side thi neutral current go neutral wire back transformer flow grounding water pipe etc thi may cause pipe possibly thing like underground fuel oil tank may also cause ac magnetic field due large loop hot conductor service neutral current water pipe ground feel field may dont flame thi im telling field come health effect far im concerned jury still thi note jumper installed main panel sub distribution panel thi one reason illegal run service entrance cable used neutral sub panel must seperate conductor neutral used thi application grounding conductor neutral grounding conductor sub panel say remove screw grounding conductor load panel ground possible problem listed code make exception range well feed one building another case range neutral may used equipment ground certain condition instead seperate wire every time code revised exception come review exception fact first required safety ground day u ground outlet manufacturer dont want redesign range contractor dont want run fmy wire cable fmy fairly heavy expensive wire place three wire question would safer seperate neutral stove neutral current low setting since current 220 volt hot except low setting wire large gauge reported case injury damage far exception survived case feed building primarily lightning protection person wiring aware isnt legal grounding conductor obviously bare wire ground anywhere green wire installed portable cord good grounding conductor bx bx connector metal box legal grounding conductor u bx ha aluminum band run steel lower resistance cut thi aluminum band end dont bond anything job every turn bx generally legal grounding conductor may require enter box panel particularly larger pipe look like big bx pull ymy wire empty run legal grounding conductor doesnt aluminum band bond steel ha much resistance run seperate green grounding conductor inside also legal grounding conductor paint box often prevent good contact feed extension often box wall may well connected first box personally discovered case entire run case everything plugged outlet run hot 120 volt get shock every time touch computer radiator office wa ground wire one outlet edge box must run ground wire back outlet least first box original wiring bx etc bond wire box screw clip whatever another issue ground green outlet ever place ground legal nec use without ground ground available better protection ground fault protection dont install doesnt depend ground trip desirable connect ground available ground connected trip soon faulty device plugged wherea without ground trip someone something provide ground path questioning legal use read nec exception thi 1990 code 93 code city know rule hasnt changed might though touched surface concerning grounding much thi subject fallen asleep john john h schmidt pe
