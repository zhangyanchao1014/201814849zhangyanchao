david subject making odd resistor value required filter ian write constructing active filter odd value resistor often required ie something like k ohm seem best choose common capacitor value cope strange resistance demanded pd program work best make resistance given fixed resistor standard 12 value per etc common enough problem yet cant recall program tell gife starting q finding prefered value xy z since youre third place assume youre using 1 tolerance resistor capacitor
