glenn sullivan subject long distance ir detection write designed built hardware 1988 would output logic level tone detector upon detecting 500 led 28 foot away used motorola biased loop variation sunlight light used lens allen sullivan would interested knowing sensing hardware use detector could detect angle location system simply respond presence transmitter sensor field view feedback base control operating point expect thi really hurt noise figure comment expert intended use thi motor provide heading beacon plan wa 3 4 beacon different frequency room tell frequency one challenge wa available 8 degree step knowing heading beacon would used technique determine robot location aint going explain net given would output circuit several expected frequency extract beacon thi numerou step even 8 degree step knowledge response able rather accurately determine heading beacon allen sullivan
