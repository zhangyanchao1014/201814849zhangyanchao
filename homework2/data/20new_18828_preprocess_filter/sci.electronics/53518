joel kolstad subject dumb question function generator article david glen write new scope thought id save buck buying one function generator built hmm wa ad combination saw function generator ha offset high way could make little box could solve thi little problem box would function generator input lower voltage give output impedance low number would want lower voltage factor one hundred could build little buffer amp id like thi box active sure youve already got right idea ignoring 50 ohm internal resistance generator second run say voltage made ohm series 10 ohm thi new circuit equivalent one put 1100 original voltage ha output le 10 ohm may want monkey value little depending whether care exact dividing ratio availability part sound joel kolstad p thi high voltage probe accurate still cheap something like 100 meg series doesnt load often high source much well keeping probably 10 meg impedance happy
