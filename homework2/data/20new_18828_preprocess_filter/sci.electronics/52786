mr cd smith subject voltage problem hi ive built valve use voltage step supply voltage approx load resistance increase rc constant decrease hence output voltage drop need high output voltage possible circuit consist seven voltage stage ie 14 diode 14 capacitor capacitor develop acros take output acros seven capacitor increase capacitor rating increase rc constant hence problem capacitor going little expensive need 14 1 would happen connected capacitor parallel output hence parallel seven capacitor assume increase c circuit hence increase rc time constant output voltage become stable thi killed two bird one stone experiencing hence amp thi new capacitor smooth thi 2 anyone suitable value choke placed output line power supply filter main lowest resistance possible ive got moment much im university ive got get finished two week hence im mailing playing iron itll cheaper long run especially 14 new large capacitor dont work planned email please cant alway read net thank advance chri name mr chri smith guitar university quest build hardware computer science ever sun may certainly ball flaming ga dh lawrence view expressed reflect private thought
