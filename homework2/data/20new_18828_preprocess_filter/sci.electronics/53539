tom subject analog system need ground plane write understand need ground plane digital system however would like know ground plane also necessary analog system note thi ground plane connected except one point signal ground keep getting conflicting answer thi ground plane analog system help reduce noise also system deal low frequency signal well one reason getting conflicting answer depend want ground plane continuou conductor good shield signal ymy board need shielding rom thing thi shielding wont much good magnetic field unles make continuou around circuit like cage flip side coin working high impedance could end plane cause problem arent likely encounter thi real problem one bit
