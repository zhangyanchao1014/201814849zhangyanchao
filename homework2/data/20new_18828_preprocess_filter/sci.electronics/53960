kevin subject cap onboard ive used capacitor reduce noise small array chip load clock line design wa cmo using design rule thought capacitor 1 dont help much output still large capacitor load capacitor signal line ground return still get ground power line bounce 2 help lot load high load clock line 3 trying suppres really high frequency forget large area capacitor since rc time constant large make metal diff put lot hole layer allowing frequent contact forget exactly wide line thi design id probably diff altogether use solid sheet instead using ha high resistance ignored speed 4 probably better trying tune ymy circuit run slightly slower edge lower voltage swing especially output spending chip area capacitor spare space die since circuit wa big tiny chip next size wa twice big needed kevin kevin due constraint light end turned
