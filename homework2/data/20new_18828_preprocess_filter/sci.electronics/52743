john subject help timing article write project wa somewhat pain design looking stable solid state timer want place thi thing ice shelf measure amount snow fall period six week every two week want trip discharge different colored ga pressure acros snow snow snow fall amount measured come different color problem trying build timer would stand cold 40 degree power source wouldnt drain looked timer standard dual timer thier temp spec wont go low also two week equate second per firing mean one big timing cap found 22 ye cap working voltage 5 volt small size time discharge 40 lower degree isnt linear wa thinking using several timer together fire end timing period cold drain battery six week pain one possibility would use solar panel thi six month anyone good idea thank advance firstly would never consider trying make timer ymy cap designed ram battery substitute rather use application wish drain cap constant current performance respect battery normal cap point big usually rated tolerance exactly particularly considering cold looking designing oscillator chain roll zero maximum count every second use something like clock would need chain give error le one percent firing time six week period course could trim oscillator give exact time oscillator remaining exactly constant 40 low anyway would suspect would far drain firing would timer circuit im experienced low temperature electronic cant guarantee thi approach best condition electronic department school university sydney australium email ph 61 2 805 fax 61 2 805
