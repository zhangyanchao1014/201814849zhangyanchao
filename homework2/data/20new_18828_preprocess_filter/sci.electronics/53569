wiring properly installed safe copper aluminum wiring however installation cover bit theory behind potential problem make ymy wiring safe main problem aluminum wiring phenomenon known cold aluminum wiring warm expand cool contract unlike copper aluminum go number cycle losis bit time make problem worse aluminum contact certain type metal resistance connection go cause heat still eventually wire may start getting hot insulation fixture attached possibly even cause fire since person usually encounter aluminum wiring move house built 70 cover basic point safe aluminum wiring suggest youre considering purchasing home aluminum wiring discovered later hire licensed inspector check wiring following thing 1 fixture eg outlet switch directly attached aluminum wiring rated device latter former safe fixture somewhat expensive ordinary one 2 wire properly connected least 34 way around screw direction connection tight repeated screw make problem worse inspection would pay connection note aluminum wiring still often used main service entrance cable 3 terminal extreme hazard aluminum wire connection using terminal proper screw connection immediately 4 sign connection insulation fixture damage 5 connection aluminum copper wire need handled specially current canadian code require wire nut used must specially marked connecting aluminum copper nec require wire connected together using special device tool material latter quite expensive practical unles rent tool 6 connected aluminum wiring mean short copper see 5 7 show reasonable neat wiring properly wire etc considering purchasing home inspection wiring show problem one two believe consider wiring safe sign problem many place suggest look elsewhere wrong used replace proper type use thi done range 3 10 per thi subject im buying house generally good idea hire inspector look house hidden wiring well inspection wiring show problem one two minor one believe consider wiring safe minor problem fixed sign problem many place suggest look elsewhere hint look obviou wiring include zip cord wiring either concealed wall hot wiring identified neutral conductor without proper grounding outlet except gfcus hanging proper switched neutral like certain wiring actually code one time sometime reveal wiring may hidden violation switch seem control nothing abandoned perhap properly terminated wiring wall switch shut group light separately controlled wall switch except really convenient switch outlet bizarre location great number box without outlet lamp box great number wire going wiring pas closet instead wall ceiling grounding wire subject thi weird stuff old style wiring year since invented electricity several different wiring style come gone buy older home may encounter thi stuff thi section describe old

made wire together soldering tape since hot neutral run separately wiring tend rather confusing neutral often run centre room tap fixture hot wire tended run one fixture next case kt isnt neutral often colmy hot wire youll see kt home built late 40 comment kt person installing kt pretty paranoid electricity tend pretty good wire insulation tend stand well kt ive seen example quite good condition grounding grounding usually difficult install box small replacement particularly gfcus difficult box either wiring change need special attention box entry sometime neutral isnt balanced well separately hot circuit sometime possible neutral without circuit building code permit insulation wall contain kt connection existing kt new circuit tricky consult ymy inspector modern wiring require considerably outlet installed kt system since kt tend pretty decent condition generally isnt necessary replace simply kt watch circuit loading many case perfectly reasonable leave existing kt alone add new fixture new circuit using modern technique kt invented cable first type see roughly cloth insulation look much like cable last decade two thi stuff wa used 40 50 grounding conductor wa installed much like modern wiring major thi type insulation weve seen whole system insulation would fall touch bx cable ha similar problem thi stuff become rather wire become bare thi wiring left much possible whenever opportunity arise replace simple switch replacement turn several hmy long fight electrical tape thi wiring technique modern wa invented almost cloth often bit thi stuff stand reasonably well doesnt present hazard reasonably easy work need replaced considered safe modern stuff insulation wire dont abuse much subject buy stuff try find proper electrical supply outlet near
