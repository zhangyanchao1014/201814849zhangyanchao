subject lead acid battery part 2 article carter ame write thought first thread wa go another post background information ha happened poor battery one year left battery garage garage left place needed one riding one motorcycle battery riding wa 34 year old one cycle battery wa new one wa around 5 year old upon spring time discovered battery dead needed worked properly except older one replaced summer originally stored garage think remember dad charging spring last year decided bring basement ha two part one dirt brick concrete brought three discovered spring 15 day ago battery dead put charger charger said read around word wa internal went battery still 2 battery also lead acid decided put charger sitting around 1 half year brick dirt part noticed needed small charge around 2 hour tested using local ga station giving jump start worked fine around 25 em thi lead believe one several thing 1 bought really battery last year sortum true 2 concrete ha something discharge battery 3 wa enough moisture short terminal room concrete 4 dirt room wa able moisture air better concrete btw almost dirt room idea could alien anything possible secondary cell release energy electricity following chemical reaction pb lead lead iv acid produce lead water standard heat formation 25 c 77 f variou compound heat formation compound 25 c pb 000 650 heat reaction 25 c therefore per produced note lead per 100 water 25 c thu solution reaction positive terminal battery almost sure positive terminal form may wrong oh well dont battery dont feel like thinking right important notice reaction knew would energy moisture acid rain battery path terminal may form thi discharge battery chemical reaction proceed reaction electricity battery charger put back battery battery must change chemical composition discharge cell ha necessary reaction post terminal battery remove add electric energy discharge charge reaction ha tendency happen though quite slowly normal circumstance keeping battery dry good idea total solution understand battery indeed discharge faster stored concrete opposed wood earth dirt one recall principle anything subjected stres act move comfortable position thermal selected material thermal material temperature c f earth 204 natural acros natural 204 parallel earth powder 100 density 18 200 300 400 500 concrete stone 14 dry acros grain 15 parallel grain 21 oak acros grain 15 maple acros grain 50 note thermal dirt earth go temperature also 204 c 400 k value earth powder order magnitude natural earth thermal concrete around factor 10 greater dirt 24 time greater wood difference thermal cause battery concrete discharge faster dirt wood instant discharge reaction energy released either electricity heat thermal air storage except pas battery thi energy mostly released heat higher surface remove heat faster lower surface thu perfectly dry battery bottom surface given battery temperature storage surface temperature battery concrete surface 10 time faster dirt thi principle come play removing energy reaction drive reaction reaction normally occur room temperature keeping battery temperature require removal heat produced concrete surface better heat sink dirt wood surface store battery corner concrete basement 3 surface removing energy pull reaction along also water battery ratio acid water thi tend drive discharge reaction jeff white get pocket french fry
