introduction molecular biology computer scientist prof university thi overview essential fact molecular biology intended introduction field computer scientist wish apply tool thi rich complex domain material covered include molecule basic organization cell genetic material central dogma gene expression selected topic area structure function regulation relate current computational approach dr ha appointment computer science biology ha extensive experience basic biological research addition hi current work computational biology introduction artificial intelligence dr richard mit corp overview field artificial intelligence presented relate actual potential biological application fundamental technique symbolic programming language notion search discussed well selected topic somewhat greater detail knowledge representation inference machine learning intended audience include computational background extensive exposure artificial intelligence dr related technology ha worked area artificial intelligence applied biological problem industry neural network statistic information theory biological sequence analysi dr alan lo alamo national laboratory thi tutorial cover intelligent system molecular biology machine learning technique applied sequence analysi closely topic addressed include use neural network specific signal general characteristic sequence relationship approach statistical technique view sequence datum dr theoretical division lo alamo ha long leader use technique thi domain genetic algorithm genetic programming prof john stanford university genetic algorithm increasingly popular approach highly problem wa originally inspired biological metaphor thi tutorial cover biological motivation actual implementation characteristic algorithm genetic programming extension problem discovery size shape solution major part problem also addressed particular attention paid biological application identifying resource software permit begin using method dr consulting
