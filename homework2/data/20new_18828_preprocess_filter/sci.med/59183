large vagina skin cause disease person unles immune system compromised also called unlike organism cause human disease produce live existence body organism considered manage take residence within body poor mucu membrane barrier let thi happen vitamin mainly responsible setting thi barrier situation prior post definitely wa immune blood test showed vitamin level low doubt heavily damaged also wa antibiotic 15 time 4 year end even two week work confirmed chronic infection vium mucu color wont get detail symptom three traditional made thi diagnosi culture done however difficulty thi right symptom clearly showed infection enough thi background provided help understand wa make comment antifungal therapy first question thi little way poor mucu membrane tissue maybe vium thu causing symptom without considered systemic classic sense sort infection steve got real upset doctor wa using antifungal vitamin gi problem steve really vitamin body would least calling doctor quack wa concerned vitamin doctor blood test put vitamin one week dropped 25000 next couple week also received zinc supplementation since fairly complex way doctor explained one evil specialist blood test three week later vitamin wa normal stopped vitamin except supplement made sure maintain 50000 betum call face hopefully doctor take similar careful approach supplement im even supplement im taking example fairly large 1 steve dyer good information ha improvement relief sinu allergy probably worth taking large dose longterm liver damage get acces lot glucose bloom ride organism living gi tract vagina though believe based successful therapy definitely excessive growth unknown specie still want ask question study demonstrate candida bloom associated sinu sinu reduced significantly one week new treatment implemented thi time noticeable gi track problem starting day went away considered normal btw doctor one hi medical reference book sorry cant remember one found obscure comment dating back 1950 stated person develop contained leading sinu inflammation symptom ill dig reference since relevant thi discussion person really develop bad inflammatory proces mucu membrane skin bloom site whether thi allergic like reaction candida isnt certain doctor tested believe similar test allergic response candida albican showed strong positive another question would everybody show strong positive thi test essentially useles assuming true candida grow mucu membrane tissue concentration exceed threshold amount could person test allergy candida definitely develop allergic symptom mucu membrane due body allergic response said earlier post one need rocket scientist md degree phd biochemistry see thi hypothesi btw ill repost thi dr hi book sinu survival ha routinely given anything else systemic antifungal safe good hi new chronic patient antibiotic fmy time last two year claim 2000 patient well 90 notice relief sinu inflammation symptom doesnt cure mean implying socalled infection primary cause later also found nystatin whether taken internally put sinu spray help thi imply course assuming excessive bloom sinu inflammation ha grown tissue since nystatin kill direct contact blood stream admit lot imply doesnt please hardcore nt ha doubleblind study one ha start plausible strawman internal symptom used symptom pretty thi bring interesting observation used deny reject aspect yeast hypothesi appropriate study done cant observe culture yeast bloom gut sinu way diagnose even recognize disease know realize virtually impossible test candida part body easily observed since candida everywhere body real another totally reject yeast hypothesi say study done actually study done certain standard perspective even considered agree appropriate study done take big right however order convince funding agency time open wallet literally give evidence acceptable evidence compete proposal almost exact study needed funding 90 study even get funding scientist national lab im aware thi smaller funded project im afraid even dr 100 doctor got together practice case history anecdote compelling picture approach funding agency would get nowhere even able publish statistical result obviou comment doctor decided excessive yeast gut leading noticeable symptom exist even hypothesi amount case history compiled anecdotal evidence contrary never change mind would also oppose needed study mind done issue excessive yeast growth leading allergic symptom exist period kind tough dialog hold viewpoint kind remind candida kept check person normal gi stomach vaginal tract compete food human immune system bother organism unles mucu membrane barrier inflammatory response set american getting enough vitamin diet 30 american die le vitamin born study thi low level vitamin cause mucu membrane barrier system thi would factor strong inflammatory response candida bloom arent also nutrient necessary proper working sinu mucu membrane suffer candida bloom common cause thi type bloom use broad spectrum antibiotic knock many different kind bacterium body remove main competition candida far food concerned drug available handle candida many patient find doctor use unles evidence systemic infection antifungal drug warrant caution gi sinu inflammation suspected recent use broad spectrum antibiotic smoking gun antifungal use antifungal cream appropriate treatment vaginal yeast infection spite mr steve dyer say evidence study indicate many specie grow root deep tissue similar growing bread continue kill surface nystatin cant kill deeper tissue without using systemic antifungal older one toxic effective thi ha pointed recent study sent doctor ive email contact thank nystatin effective long term treatment gi tract like trying garden cutting ground leaving root ready come walk away question whether contained candida bloom partially grow tissue mucu membrane causing type symptom susceptible person eg allergy without becoming systemic classical sense word something strictly excessive bloom causing problem systemic infection potentially lethal gi system region seem particularly good candida use many woman create favorable environment around moisture candida vaginal tract one way thi transfer wear also one like ive diagnosed prior post also provide site excessive candida growth bloom occur area burning pain even blood discharge make many patient think bloom manage move gi tract discomfort blood thi positive blood sent family doctor first place extensive testing told wa nothing wrong gut still hurt another doctor richard ha told email consider blood test waste time money large number false bloom guy gut hurt constant basi would want fixed ye nice know dont colon cancer causing distres finally find doctor treat get 90 better steve dyer call quack ive said private email flaw current medical system make difficult even impossible physician attempt alternative therapy therapy dont work example went three said live ab failed mention surgery open werent plugged would get root cause condition three month aggressive fairly nonstandard therapy body nutrient level monitoring vitamin c etc health ha vastly improved wa two year ago health greatly course skeptic would say maybe nothing would improved anyway view thing quite far experience three saw said id live im confident reach one could call total cure antifungal program wa one necessary step direction ab last fmy year note sinu problem may suggest book dr mention sure get revised edition often wondered md chronic gi distres sinu problem would problem tell hi patient nonexistent syndrome dr started chronic severe sinu problem hi visit several totally said youll live spent several year trying everything standard nonstandard wa essentially cured chronic share hi approach hi book honestly say road recovery following part hi one recommendation take systemic antifungal beginning treatment history antibiotic ha proven time time hi practice im sure commented hardcore belief antus yeast hypothesi poster would definite thing say worked wonder almost two thousand case put also would surprised would say one violating moral obligation help patient maybe doctor reading thi practice patient symptom could due hypothetical yeast eg fit profile person identified consider antifungal therapy avenue remember theory practice two different thing one without doctor something nonstandard yet produce noticeable relief thousand hi patient shouldnt least sit take notice maybe ought trust say begin work instead shouldnt work im afraid lot doctor become scientific ignoring patient help balanced dont see poster thi group come point use little common sense maybe empirical approach trying good systemic antifungal avenue wa one traditional medical establishment wa able help natural thing went couple doctor somewhat outside thi establishment result found significant relief would better traditional medical establishment set kind mechanism doctor without fear hi license pulled try experimental beyond doubt therapy hisher patient finally reach point accepted therapy ineffective id like hear doctor tell well ive tried therapy approved accepted thi country since clearly dont work authority use experimental technique seem helped cant promise anything risk sign something saying understand experimental possibly risky nature therapy ill register ymy case state board anyway suggested thi jumped thi instead going one doctor either reason greed practicing alternative therapy much risk risk meaning losing license possibly patient mechanism would keep control mainstream medicine also provide valuable datum would essentially free also would morally better current system showing compassion medical community patient everything within reason help patient lack mechanism leading large number person try alternative therapy seem work like case never work true better get thi post reach size taken also become major bacterium gut spray ha also used sinu membrane thi occur mucu membrane barrier system need thi accomplished vitamin vitamin c vitamin diet survey repeatedly show american getting enough b6 probably population greatest problem thi nonexistent bloom antibiotic therapy b6 appear necessary promote healing proper working material wa obtained natural healing mark published pres well note human nutrition course posting discussion vitamin sometime future along reference citing point extremely important role vitamin play mucu membrane defense system body vitamin effective dealing candida bloom another effective dietary treatment restrict intake treatment phase thi especially important gi system involved candida get glucose going grow bacterium give bacterium use acid acid energy chance take keep candida check returned gut id like see role complex steve want jump thi post fine jumped steve scus med nutrition poster wa seeking advice doctor use vitamin antifungal candida bloom gut person seeking advice treated thi way u giving time
