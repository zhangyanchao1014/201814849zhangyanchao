jame foster subject gun like american expres card article vincent fox write jason kratz u28037uicvmuicedu write deleted far weapon lot better armed want hit aim seem happening situation getting totally blown proportion post wa referring ymy regular car around city v gang member course polouse acces thing mentioned use tank time course dont point wa trying make every day go lunch alway see cop coming majority see still carrying revolver anything wrong revolver youre cop gang member couple automatic hi coat mean semiauto handgun youre going disadvantage even training shooting range gang gang member practicing shooting actually practicing taking gun quick possible shooting target werent badly either university cop state cop armed better chicago polouse seem state cop every city polouse officer ive seen around twin city last two year ha carried semiauto type different brand though havent seen glock regard thi discussion getting far usual ranting tpg close realm id like put two cent worth nothing wrong revolver especially large frame sw 357 favorite valid advantage semiauto suggest reading know person cant stand think full bull think general hi material valid useful book semi auto pistol polouse work something like define number way semiauto different different good main advantage increased accurate followup shot go single action mode also certain nature gun take learn thi may time criminal become familiar different model semiauto wa cited stopping least slowing criminal grabbed polouse officer gun define armed better go shoot revolver semiauto like colt 45 one fire faster nope aside faster rate fire usually desirable sure make guy duck cover trying hitting anything thompson thi military limiting simple semiauto would better troop like able rock roll even ammo something often short supply enemy revolver equally capable semiauto caliber revolver also ha advantage pull trigger revolver almost first fire merely pulling trigger ye thi best done two hand hold single hand either pull gun far target must fire double action da semi auto ha advantage plu alway sa first shot revolver merely mean must pull trigger rotate next round im sure thi meant different ymy first point da semiauto pull trigger try dropping hammer round advantage dont revolver next trigger pull alway go next round discussing thi point thi fine situation granted rare ymy round go cylinder place go slide take little time revolver carried 6th chamber empty hammer maximum safety still drawn fired easy motion even one handed actually modern revolver design hammer block thi necessary usually recommended revolver would fall hard enough right angle actually break hammer driver firing pin round set revolver allow almost fast magazine semiauto faster depending user best user especially using spring loaded speed fast problem spent case two handed job dropping magazine one handed thi mean fresh magazine soon old one clear gun speed go motion alway take time also dont advantage tactical replacing partial magazine bring back full capacity partial magazine still used needed later semiauto require clear shell first time spent fatal vital second often lost realize hey starting anything clearing ye time recognize problem important time clear really though either revolver semiauto odd actual factory ammo awfully small likely get semiauto even rare modern quality gun sig glock semiauto must slide worked chamber first round hammer polouse carry semiauto chamber loaded hammer safety engaged consider thi safe however must safety get speed employment revolver semiauto complexity operation many require training common semiauto carried round chamber without safety problem put statement believe say thi apply one ive looked da semi different revolver situation gun hammer firing pin block also safety real advantage carrying one locked safety speed employment revolver plu advantage sa followup shot im familiar sa semiauto except admit wa initially skeptical carrying thi locked examining design trying defeat safety gun course shooting lot see inherent safety problem especially strap hammer thi design also get speed accurate first shot revolver polouse department switched glock started quietly switching many officer back old revolver many accident partly due poor training received glock require rocket scientist cop something complex timer vcr yeah infamou glock still cant figure worse revolver safety dont pull trigger doesnt go imagine ymy revolver shooting wa done double action could pull glock trigger far enough fire realized addition developed nasty habit keeping ymy finger trigger ymy gun relying ymy thumb hammer remind take blew ymy foot youd problem hammer wasnt anyone go anyone saying criminal obviously polouse dont know nothing firearm turn cop hunter pay attention seek say semiauto junk merely assuming better job stupid cop revolver hi hip shotgun rack equipped anything short riot think thi even okay riot long small one b gun control hitting aim fire real fast may find dont hit anything good controlled fire revolver likely get hit consider inferior carry weapon something like security six revolver havent hit im first 5 shot something quite seriously wrong somewhere might like backup capacity extra shot certain case shot fired criminal encounter le 5 poor man tauru 99 consider inferior carry weapon springfield 45 oop v 45 argument right though dont hit aim combination ha failed dont failure fire real fast scenario mention gun thi failure whether lack discipline lack training crook use crime nice simple 38 revolver polouse often use well actually polouse prefer much 357 anyway becoming popular crook though 38 still lead list like said around semiauto seem rule street cop dont know state patrol however may still carry highway dont flame prefer semiauto thing introduce something encounter lone criminal vincent please dont take thi flame 002 look like 200 worth much imho check book everything gone planned everything would perfect batf cnn regarding failed raid attempt tx
