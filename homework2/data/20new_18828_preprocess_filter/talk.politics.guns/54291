vikingiastateedu dan sorenson subject weapon militium long fcraryucsucoloradoedu frank crary write odd line must making progress ironic note deleted line emac continually gave message garbage collecting done think trying tell something vikingiastateedu dan sorenson write thank great change tired old debate join time know talkpoliticsgun newsgroup would thought exactly reason thi sort restriction possible poorly maintained rifle dangerou user since doesnt justification restriction remind consider 5 reasonable space limitation make mistake gun blowing hazard nearby say next lane range point wa distance level threat draw line 5 restriction possibility shot hence draw 15 mile restriction draw 5 mile restriction al suffer fundamental flaw restrict based upon instrument rather placing responsibility usage upon shoulder user perhap light fifty assault rifle ha made thi apparent since ha range going determined life worth effort protect home family using nuclear weapon close home accomplish thi disagree ground house rebuilt much easily family died assume word would get citizen attack wa planned thi case tactical strategic implication change quite bit personally home worth say twenty martian intent taking world family act hard judge sitting desk however another problem case civil war strength militia fighting side reflect popular public split 67 versu 33 minority militia 21 disadvantage need popular support would hopefully prevent unles person really behind heavy weapon owned small fraction militium could thi 33 minority included tank artillery owner seem case already given heavy weapon arent commonly owned low number obviously due cost dont think superior weapon going great effect superior furthermore even training include proper tactical movement best utilize tank wherea commonly effectivenes think vital avoid situation small minority would reasonable chance gaining political power violence prevent thi may necessary give control heavy weapon eg small number individual would whose would relation popular support military strength someone individual thi certainly good thing think lesser two evil whoever control weapon must democratic body person perhap officer select group like would exercise control heavier complex weapon joe bob old tank certainly wouldnt ask give follow order officer ye since expense tank large though chance would purchased therefore maintained operated think state talking certainly one role militium government would completely destructive end government control militia arm united state several level government able act independently likely target state local government unlikely think therefore state possibly local government could safely allowed keep select militia heavy weapon risk abuse still something consider far le similar risk federal government control thi ill agree point state control heavy weapon justification state located keep spread ability state lock isnt easy otherwise would assume state control would rest authority governor militium officer think removed select militium militia heavy weapon specialist reason outline think heavy weapon tank artillery aircraft etc better kept local government small number individual however local government shouldnt able use select militium without support person ideally general militium direct control person select militium direction democratic local government would together even worst case general militium able functional without select militium similarly select militium incapable action without aid general militium im hard time seeing heavy weapon fairly number could easily person government support argued weapon democratic control one side doesnt cant see thi situation select militium holding weapon militium think better mix called would argue federal army rely upon select militium militium bulk unit consider effect removing national guard placing guard control local government select militium could fight effectively without support provided general militium inherently organization hand general militium could function although disadvantage without backing local government select militium assume would would side force theyve equipment force 3x size would trouble id like see heavy stuff say tank offset local 105 weapon would much useful tank would cost training requirement figured suppose im constitute heavy equipment unit build time flood set disaster relief city like would much rather see thing handled local general militia would resource often arent available local unit well enough thu certainly call unit carry stuff faster anything else perhap national guard isnt close conception select militium thought wa considering heavy arm militium arm regular army perhap idea heavy weapon different think main battle tank artillery field piece heavy stuff troop carrier 2 12 ton truck old tank 105 stuff actually thi guard unit iowa currently fielding unit perhap fear real heavy equipment state control little number light stuff act allowing main battle tank state balanced capability local rank similarly local unit would need band together quickly hence small fast response mean finally militium fighting equipment needed response federal army im convinced relying state local militia function dan sorenson dod vikingiastateedu isu censor read say dont blame usenet post exotic distant machine
