jimmy r subject path algorithm statu expected run time factor 10 486dx50 using best known algorithm finding path solution cube randomly chosen position read faq followed recent discussion cube dont believe thi question ha answered notice specifically looking algorithm find path solution seem underlying assumption program would need brute force search though 1020 position seem assumption want know someone ha significantly improved idea approach thi problem spend much time developing wanted know someone else ha already done work posted thi three group attempted set followup seem place continue thi discussion cro post summary become appropriate email reply accepted jimmy
