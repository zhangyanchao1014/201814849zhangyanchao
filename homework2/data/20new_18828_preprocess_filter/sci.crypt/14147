marc subject ripem frequently asked question archivename sun 7 mar 93 0500 thi posting thi still rather rough listing likely question information ripem program public key mail encryption thi faq ripem wa written maintained marc posted variety newsgroup monthly basi followup discussion specific ripem group thi month thi posting attempt comply standard faq formatting allow easy manipulation thi document world wide web let know think disclaimer nothing thi faq considered legal advice anything one person opinion want real legal advice talk real lawyer question answer 1 ripem ripem program perform privacy enhanced mail pem using cryptographic technique rsa de allows ymy electronic mail property authentication ie sent confirmed privacy ie nobody read except intended recipient ripem wa written primarily mark code public domain except rsa routine library called licensed rsa datum security inc 2 get ripem ripem contain library cryptographic routine considered thu distribution person citizen permanent resident u canada therefore following request quoted readme file please export cryptographic code thi distribution outside usa canada thi personal request author ripem condition ymy use ripem note public domain license included distribution read using ripem best way get ask friend copy since thi reduce load site carry mention human run naturally thi require trust friend ripem available vium anonymou ftp citizen permanent resident u cd read readme file info last looked thi site contain source tree contain compiled binary nice mac version ripem well stuff ha home site open ftp user u canada citizen permanent resident find obtain acces ftp cd read file convenience binary many architecture available addition full source tree 3 ripem run machine probably ha already ported msdo flavor unix suno next linux aix ultrix solari etc port macintosh include standard port rather nice port written raymond lau author stuffit port expected help user invited 4 ripem work mailer probably easy clean effective interface depend mailer though user guide included distribution discus way use ripem many popular mailer including berkeley mh code also included allow easy use ripem inside gnu emac make new interface ripem create improvement one distribution believe convenient use secure may useful feel free post 5 rsa rsa crypto system publickey thi mean two different related key one encrypt one decrypt one reasonably derived may publish ymy encryption public key widely keep ymy decryption private key anyone use ymy public key encrypt message hold private key needed decrypt note message sent rsa normally de key real message see de note provide privacy authentication message see like md5 encrypted sender private key recipient use sender public key decrypt confirm message must come sender rsa wa named three man shamir invented find rsa ftp look look scicrypt 6 de de datum encryption standard widely used symmetric crypto system unlike rsa de use key encrypt decrypt message however de much faster rsa ripem use de rsa generate random key encrypt ymy mail de using key encrypt key recipient public rsa key include result letter allowing recipient recover de key de sometime considered weak somewhat old use key length considered short modern standard however reasonably safe opponent smaller large corporation government agency unlikely future ripem symmetric cipher possibly using multiple encryption de 7 pem ripem relate pem privacy enhanced mail system allowing easy transfer encrypted electronic mail described rfc document approved obsolete old rfc ripem really complete implementation pem pem specify key ripem handle thi time addition planned 8 thi key remote user able send secure mail must know ymy public key able confirm message received came must know public key important thi information accurate bad guy convince hi key fact send message read ripem allows three method key management central server distributed finger server flat file three described ripem user guide part distribution none provide perfect security 9 ripem public key look similar ripem public key begin describing variou characteristic key first bunch character ymy key may lot people key thi mean ymy key similar clas key generated program length etc 10 like md5 md5 message digest algorithm produced rsa datum security inc provide secure hash plaintext secure possible reasonable amount computation produce different plaintext produce thu instead signing entire message sender private key md5 message need signed authentication md5 sometime used purpose example often used map input arbitrary length 128 bit datum interpreter cookie generator md5 described including implementation c rfc 11 pgp pgp another cryptographic mail program called pretty good privacy pgp ha around longer ripem work somewhat differently pgp compatible ripem way though pgp also use rsa major difference pgp ripem pgp ha key management feature particularly user without direct network connection ripem conform pem rfc thu ha greater probability working pem software pgp make attempt compatible anything pgp fact pgp 10 compatible pgp 20 ripem use library rsa routine rsa datum security inc come license allows noncommercial use pgp use implementation rsa licensed thu firm holding u patent rsa algorithm claim patent make use sell pgp u canada thi pgp original author phil say documentation fact live usa federal agency shouldnt actually run pgp ymy computer public key partner want forbid running software pgp pgp ripem sent outside u canada however pgp already exist many ftp site europe place whether use pgp ripem whatever documentation pgp recommended reading anyone interested issue note fact regarding patent export restriction somewhat controversial many person think shouldnt way person interpret variou document differently unfortunately discussion net inevitably seem produce heat light probably belong see disclaimer 12 stand rabin privacy enhanced mail wa similar ripem used publickey cipher invented rabin rsa attempt avoid patent rsa wa written mark author ripem distribution wa contrary belief many including rabin public key partner claimed patent wa broad enough cover publickey cipher whose strength difficulty product large prime rsa thi claim universally accepted mean wa challenged reason really used anymore compatible ripem pgp 13 stand internet mail extension described rfc find newsgroup pem interact yet entirely clear person use solution type order send ripem message one hope standard emerge draft internet document exist matter 14 thi simple way defeat security ripem may wish check companion post discus obviou attack ripem security procedure minimize risk ripem main weak area probably key distribution
