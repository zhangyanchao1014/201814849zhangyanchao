paul subject clipper chip long follow article jim write thi document anonymou ftp directory nist look like shoe ha dropped jim 25 sr 1993 thank posting thi making available thi post long comment leaving original place provide context please note alt group ha set clipper stuff note thi file also available vium anonymou file transfer csrcncslnistgov directory vium nist computer security bb white house office pres secretary immediate release april 16 1993 statement pres secretary president today announced new initiative bring federal government together industry voluntary att industry wonder happened ibm thi right street scheme voluntary mr would love thi program improve security privacy telephone communication meeting legitimate need law enforcement telephone encryption year behind digital one like rsa idea even de true strawman claim context circuit email like initiative involve creation new product accelerate development use advanced secure telecommunication network communication link would propose use isdn would thi lot long ha little dialogue private sector law enforcement community resolve tension economic real challenge protecting american rather use technology accommodate sometime competing interest economic growth privacy law enforcement previou policy government industry right privacy law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology ha used year protect electronic fund transfer used protect electronic mail computer file encryption de technology help american protect busines secret unauthorized release personal information also used terrorist drug dealer criminal note use word busines whole thi release seem establishing ground rule busines use legitimate debate want nothing drop ymy wife ear remain secret private even agenda debate note role contain private info thi reference information already hand unauthorized release bit also drawing long case person legitimate acces revealing often selling info person course thi proposal person key criminal also use court cium official pen go busines well yeah several would better idea clipper protection law court seriously last decade microcircuit called clipper chip ha developed government engineer chip represent nsa new approach encryption technology yeah thi bit true used new relatively inexpensive encryption device attached ordinary telephone telephone communication using encryption algorithm powerful many commercial use today note repeated mixing telephone encryption demo claim pot would good night entertainment suspect note also many general tone imply thi new technology help company protect proprietary information protect privacy personal phone conversation prevent unauthorized release datum transmitted electronically time thi technology preserve ability federal state local law enforcement agency intercept phone conversation criminal case record seem indicate needed brutal current bus heard yet case wa use secure encryption man black side abuse law well documented even govt agency phone v com yet keyescrow system established ensure clipper chip used protect privacy lawabiding american keyescrow system established ensure clipper chip used protect privacy lawabiding american let run line twice carefully say stated purpose key make use clipper note word ensure protect lawabiding leave person asked included encryption answer thi pres release ye device containing chip two unique key number needed authorized government agency decode message encoded device device manufactured two key separately two keyescrow datum basis established attorney general acces key limited government official legal authorization conduct wiretap wiretap clipper chip technology provide law enforcement new authority acces content private conversation american make sure illegal one demonstrate effectivenes thi new technology attorney general soon purchase several thousand new device addition respected expert outside government offered acces confidential detail algorithm ass capability publicly report finding find many expert ex kgb person looking contract later posting ask already interesting see military u start use secure isnt govt answer point action chip important step addressing problem encryption sword encryption help protect privacy individual industry also shield criminal terrorist need clipper chip approach provide lawabiding citizen acces encryption need prevent criminal using hide illegal activity order ass technology trend explore new approach like keyescrow system president ha directed government agency develop comprehensive policy encryption accommodate privacy citizen including need employ voice datum encryption busines purpose personal use seem question ability authorized official acces telephone call datum proper court legal order necessary protect citizen ah alway needed seem effective use modern technology build national information infrastructure needed promote economic growth american industry global need u company manufacture export high technology product seem slightly thi president ha directed early frequent consultation affected industry congres group advocate privacy right individual policy option developed administration committed working private sector development national information infrastructure use new telecommunication computer technology give american acces information thi infrastructure highspeed network information transmit video image programming huge datum file easily today telephone system transmit voice note thi stuff secret proper person able expres opinion hence desired result emerge since encryption technology play increasingly important role infrastructure federal government must act quickly develop consistent comprehensive policy regarding use administration committed policy protect american right privacy also protecting break law encryption code around technology time systematic study ha resulted swing favor moment doubt problem fall time probably practical purpose middle next century information provided accompanying fact sheet provision president directive acquire new encryption technology also available additional detail call mat national institute standard technology 301 question answer clinton administration telecommunication initiative q thi approach expand authority government agency listen phone conversation clipper chip technology provide law enforcement new authority acces content private conversation american q suppose law enforcement agency conducting wiretap drug smuggling ring intercept conversation encrypted using device would message would obtain legal authorization normally court order wiretap first place would present documentation thi authorization two entity responsible key obtain key device used drug key split two part stored separately order ensure security key escrow system q run keyescrow datum bank two keyescrow datum bank run two independent entity thi point department justice administration yet determine agency keyescrow datum bank little hard q strong security device sure strong security thi system secure many voice encryption system readily available today note drop back thi true answer suck big time anyone drive use light algorithm remain classified protect security key escrow system thi link security actual algorithm real winner given 2 secret 40 bit number could someone please explain detail encryption algorithm reveal willing invite independent panel cryptography expert evaluate algorithm assure potential user make sure read real ok q whose decision wa propose thi product national security council justice department commerce department key agency involved thi decision thi approach ha endorsed president vice president appropriate cabinet official quick looking back name missing list q wa consulted congres industry ongoing discussion congres industry encryption issue expect discussion carry review encryption policy briefed member congres industry leader decision related thi initiative person agree u think buck q government provide hardware manufacturer government designed developed key acces encryption microcircuit providing microcircuit product manufacturer product manufacturer acquire microcircuit chip manufacturer produce reverse engineering provision act could q provide clipper chip program facility californium sell chip encryption device manufacturer programming function could licensed vendor future q buy one encryption device expect several manufacturer consider clipper chip device dont unles one right person q administration unable find technological solution like one proposed would administration willing use legal remedy restrict acces powerful encryption device thi fundamental policy question considered broad policy review key escrow missed word secret need grammar lesson mechanism provide american encryption product secure convenient le expensive readily available today one piece must comprehensive approach encryption technology administration developing would say le secure le expensive pgp free le available prone proof welcome note proof administration saying since encryption threaten public safety effective law enforcement prohibit outright country effectively done u saying every american matter right entitled unbreakable commercial encryption product dont seem saying anything make much sense thi proposal prohibit except limited way thi one explicit reference personal right denial ye dont think mexican canuck included clinton et al gesture false tension created assessment thi issue proposition rather concern fact balanced reasoned balanced approach proposed clipper chip similar encryption technique false tension false balance two point right privacy putting behind false assessment assumed removal right take ever step suitable protect ymy privacy non negotiable hence defined language dont agree must criminal criminal dont agree law also note non question wa possible q thi decision indicate clinton administration policy toward encryption differ bush administration indicate understand importance encryption technology telecommunication computing committed working industry group find innovative way protect american privacy help business compete ensure law enforcement agency tool need fight crime terrorism indicate know bush dropped ball nasty insert suitable stamp thi outbreak freedom sentiment q device device use government hardware voice encryption device subject export control requirement review export required ensure appropriate use device true encryption device one attraction thi technology protection give u company operating home abroad thi mind expect export license granted basi u company seeking use device secure communication abroad plan review possibility wider product thi one real australium france reveal key algorithm dont think top list thing must restriction protect trying sell bill using must nut good luck folk paul
