criterium de apply general may found brown et al property product cipher let e product cipher map block block let encryption x key k fixed k map sending x set block denote thi set called symmetric group written collection k range possible key e random mapping plaintext ciphertext would expect generate large subset shown simple product cipher generate group given sufficient number round group half symmetric group consist even ie written even number swap even able extend result show cipher generate given sufficient number round security multiple also depend property cipher multiple extension single key exist third key indicate encrypting twice two independent key equal single encryption third key every exist true say e group thi question whether de group thi definition wa
