anonymou posting method work far thi practice widespread may become common widespread anonymou filtering 84 history behind anonymou posting server originally anonymou posting service introduced individual particularly newsgroup anonymity almost preferred method communication one first wa one dave mack started 1988 another early one wa run enterprise wa due lack fund system provided anonymou return address john took function thi server including anonymou alia file group ha server like tomorrow interested idea karl developed hi system scratch six hour thi time idea server new mainstream group wa starting emerge possibility partly specific request multiple user anonymity group intended advantage system wa specifically allow multiple group support single anon acros thi wa single biggest deficiency previou anon system k posted message asking user whether anonymou service would welcome judged consensu k introduced call fire abusive user response complaint used thi three case nevertheles month intense traffic wa eventually bus hi server even restricted wa system wa subjected bus point wa ordered facility staff bus started right wa created nov 1992 johan set controversial anonymou site date based script c code written k support mail posting return address initially wanted service user expanded worldwide response lot international request j policy allowing anonymou posting every usenet newsgroup ha met strong seriou ideological opposition eg news relative recent medium bus anonymou poster tend higher routine bus hi total commitment anonymity also controversial example highly controversial case feb 1993 anonymou user posted supposed desperate crew dialogue shuttle disaster vium despite posted place year earlier actually originated poster new york news subsequent response consisted largely outrage poster use anonymity many newsgroup original poster using anonymou handle later story seemed likely suggesting plausible possibility original intent wa outrage gauge reaction story albeit free personal risk perceived association item generated query original article reader anonymou user later posted deliberately offensive comment hi despite complaint even opposition abuse k news operator j ha largely avoided use fire group mechanism limit scope service march 1993 site best described ha registered user initial three month operation forward 3000 message day approximately 5 usenet posting site probably largely due capability global anonymity ha allowed user find creative use diverse area previously johan ha subject extraordinary pressure hi server feb 1993 one point k threatened publicly sort group news operator send command message site j ha also threat server server ha crashed several time least due anonymou user mr report spending 5 hour per day answering email request alone associated service administration response seriou threat disabled global group acces temporarily one week encouraged hi user defend service publicly based dialogue creative suggestion j ha identified many security weakness valuable new feature service currently proces code development testing planning upgrading ibm compatible 386 machine 486 soon handle load considering new system sophisticated functionality including multiple email alia allocation control publickey encryption etc sophisticated anonymou posting system wa set dec 1992 used cryptography direction tofrom server highest degree seen far however wa running public acces account shut several week upon receiving request condition apparently ultimately representative ha released software public domain recently idea newsgroup devoted government bus ha received wide attention group formation currently basic scenario group would allow person post using remailer even establish reputation based digital signature traffic may eventually reach reporter mainstream news medium ha attack multiple aspect thi project including documentation posting encryption see also section view anonymou posting going thi document thank carl david johan contribution 85 value anonymity think anonymou post help attention content one message sure lot anonymou post abusive case user find anon facility novel wear stopping morgan dont mind seeing miscellaneou thing part nature however notion providing anonymity shield idea strong feeling cant put name posting quite frankly communication person refuse use name david many seem question value anonymity say risk another individual take question thi rather conservative society live holding certain view making certain statement certain lifestyle likely result public los statu employment even legal action given legal jurisdiction many contributor usenet post know legal say anonymou poster stand counted perhap one point view right exercise censorship doug censorship expect someone speak themself without anonymity thi best lame argument tell say require anonymity tell wish majority user newsgroup dont want anonymou post anonymou user le right legitimate usenet participant would honor rfd control message vote one bradclarinetcom brad templeton think disadvantage caused anon posting site doesnt already exist fact make naive net user dont know post old way prone tom speak regard anonymou posting seriou discussion pretty much worthles view hide behind anon hardly worth trouble reading hank since began posting show support general principle personal privacy subject far abuse attack ever received person seem find easier flame insult someone whose name dont know perhap easier pretend person behind email addres feel sting abusive comment anonymity method controlling poster action person seek control naturally oppose instead making thi medium allowing poster protect themself anonymity simply require poster prepared discus source information take heat thi seem way thing currently done gregory three thread going started anonymou poster one wa changing job work le hour job sharing woman didnt want anyone current place work know wa thinking looking work elsewhere next wa woman thinking baby sometime soon doesnt want friend family etc etc know want advice third sex actually thi wa started person posting usual way wa pointed anonymou posting service might let person participate doesnt seem suffering harm presence anonymou poster fact seem helped dan ha never real security anonymou forged posting usenet proces ha sufficiently limit use person learned culture net hand recent use anonymou posting service seemed seemed student asking help problem ha attributed teacher asking explanation dubiou answer hi teaching guide say hi news posting broken using anonymou service gateway karl argue opinion person hide behind anonymity worthles person thought agree latter point ideal world would sitting around dialogue freely opinion effort learn ideal world nobody threaten ymy thought live world person dont agree may try harm let face person arent going agree ymy opinion matter logically try present reasoned may thi sad since restrict person opinion richard e consensu seem general anonymou posting service seem sufficiently trust net thi particular experiment ended perhap next time question come say tried learned harm good stopped alexander anonymou posting ha created major problem aside person like would rather ban posting altogether real man stand said comparable argument brought dave haye example human nature three question folk person really say different thing based upon whether identity isnt known person really affected person say labeled abuse importantly forum prize freedom communication enjoy really thing freedom communication terry sigh many anon service needed everybody start running one soon purpose stand benefit n anon service ha thi sudden anon service come better imho worse look like gon na get stuck thing much dont like idea service like thi becoming norm dont really think much done since obviou anyone want set one bit work karl weak reasoning freedom come responsibility dave haye responsibility isnt real true come 86 anonymou posting group allowed morgan first admit hold controversial opinion indeed im sure none u completely orthodox opinion however ive received hundred anonymou email message last year fewer 20 reasonable post made good motive getting difficult remember need anonymity thing truly need service would put good use im suggesting ban anonymou server ive said several situation anonymity good thing tm however notion anonymity shield automatically extended every usenet discussion ridiculou open door abuse tim course one determine whether group request service flat majority poster voting favor positive margin 100 vote one speak newsgroup im convinced argument anonymou posting service newsgroup inherently bad idea simply statu since statu previously permitted anonymou posting newsgroup anonymou posting service would reject statu richard write suggest newsgroup best able decide whether want allow anonymou posting instead forced upon service administrator brian w service provide mechanism mail original poster since usenet reader dont know john smith jane except opinion addres effect anonymou posting mail reply directed minimal except personally know lack anonymity could seriou mechanism like thi liable abuse benefit well cost must limiting service alt group specific group would help want advice sensitive issue professional newsgroup additional point u find technical matter offensive different forum ha different meaning get phone call someone wont identify hang get u mail return addres go garbage someone street wearing mask back away carefully expecting violence technical discussion mean individual isnt willing associate matter discussed discredit hi make listening waste time lead fun experiment literature filled variou thing person wont otherwise including one study involving torture would passed today ethical standard fun stuff case fine leave u joe buck obviously never submitted article journal receive anonymou review server editor behave much like one finland eg may reply editor maintain anonymity ymy comparison someone want expres technical issue person approach dark street ski mask emotionally nonsense poster pose physical threat j seem obviou default allow anonymou posting newsgroup usenet ha alway operated principle statu kept unles large number person want change someone really need post message anonymou newsgroup thi usually isnt done usually find someone net thi dont need automated service automated service nature incapable making judgment call necessary decide whether particular posting really need anonymou tim newsgroup name bet scenario involving need secrecy accurate filter anonymou posting could screen dont require secrecy wonderful cant done newsgroup want noise call thi happen basi general usenet ban anonymou posting course one principle might keep anonymou posting could achieved automatically would still personally would prefer criterium based actual content david group doesnt want receive certain post become moderated clearly defined mechanism group thi take place automated moderator excluding post certain eg anonymou site individual could easily established anyone want take approach welcome good luck doubt reading group dave possible need would someone posting scus group sure adult willing post name would want hide behind anonymou posting service ashamed say trying person without fear identified anonymou posting place certain group anyone else need tell group youve another planet breathing exotic gas long bloody fascinating proponent universal anon posting acces cant seem find middle ground perception thi instant syndrome come want anon acces want control freak remember thi newsgroup poster writing scientific issue anonymou discussion scientific issue lead bad science noringnetcomcom jon noring though many personal philosophical argument anonymou poster argument compelling enough convince anonymou posting banned severely restricted though prove seem like anonymou posting principle reason personal read psychological discomfort rather reason related maintaining integrity usenet remember impossible able conceivable legitimate motive anonymou posting newsgroup one normally would sensitive general fear even letting newsgroup reader vote either allowing allowing anonymou posting since know motive legitimate poster believe system ever would posting legitimate informative post j write personally dont believe posting appropriate seriou discussion area legitimate reason poster identity perhap simply theyre sure want name attached doesnt qualify legitimate book oh come legitimate purpose anonymou posting please enlighten stuart p three u founding father madison hamilton jay seemed think anonymou posting wa ok federalist paper originally printed new york newspaper attributed wonder would find purpose legitimate 87 system operator anonymou posting ed mcguire would like know junk article posted anonymou service currently discussed ideally would actually tell feed site feed article posted anonymou service assuming c news performance release simple way accomplish thi look learn david bit isnt ymy user decided would like thi decided ed mcguire good question nobody ha decided definite plan thi wanted technical datum carl position offering service promise protection anonymity would limited basi personal opinion get posted basi posting smooth operation usenet obviou direct would abusive individual le possibility exist software support fire individual prevented posting john since usenet democracy someone want run anonymou service busines want put host ymy ymy busines want posting site person site everyone ignore service service effectively doesnt exist jonathan server allow posting anyone service net net terminal server problem open server allow person want thing internet without public acces site thi country world allow inexpensive acces usenet internet reason server allow anyone post message reason terminal server allow anyone connect make connection perhap wa harder get internet usenet open server could justified think point show clearly anonymou posting service ha great deal responsibility toward client toward net whole service imho set rule contract client sign term assured anonymity problem used poster vague way complaining usually sysadmin organization poster belong surely approach solving problem experience net show user anonymou posting first write detailed poster hi post another anonymou posting prevent thi kind eric main point would like make go news sw reject anon post technical newsgroup thing think attempt prove attempt modify news result changed approach anon service provider change think thi would pointles johan tried stay thi discussion see discussion lead rally feel like speak repeatedly made clear block user continue abuse warned many case user taken warning stopped case even public warning ha desired effect blocked number user also blocked acces group ha taken vote ban anonymou posting although feel changing newsgroup statu moderated permanent solution newsgroup want discussion richard e thi mean issue request discussion ban anonymou posting moderate 4000 newsgroup ymy server reach dont think thi illustrate trouble ymy server causing please listen consensu news administrator thi group newsgroup consulted letting ymy server post message group alexander consensu news administrator maybe would like invent one number person concerned possible minor extent actual abuse server configured concern johan dealing rage foam mouth condemn service altogether number defend pointing like gregory even group like benefit posting johan answered lot personal mail related server abuse result blocked number abusive user also service several newsgroup user taken vote issue made comment partly password feature emergency measure security hole ha kept really busy answering user query last two week partly feel justify service user problem rather representing person strong interest control richard thi seem rather attitude would consider thi group anyone wish discus net controlled saying interest control clear indication bia perfectly welcome join discussion promote ymy view control thi whole debate lot sound nothing even decide ban anonymou posting server person could enforce control international link policy change made cooperation attempting dictate need persuade run service act like thi friendly trying beat head stick especially stick dont even steve pope finding thi bia boring friend posting ha point old guard would like keep network way alway ha thi new thing server cut bitch every time slightest abuse somebody sig long try argument ill go record saying three cheer admin anon server like acces service provider willing preserve client privacy try defeat restrict al billing wouldnt help person get rid anon posting group dont like someone say put anon addres ymy kill file course get anon site going im going assign fake name like instead avoid hassle youll never know anonymou bennett must admit thi argument see value anonymou posting circumstance yet believe strongly identified person wish read material person wont identify themself dont fail see good would indeed cause many person hiding anonymity posting ymy anonymou site would care justify hell get try prevent person effectively filtering news see fit david thought wa reach australium unfortunately one u site involved feed complained australian academic network site connected anything particular concept anonymou mail feature narrow bandwidth link cant argue wa stop service face consider service rather unfortunate wish finnish remailer luck pity similar service provided u gues benefit constitution guarantee one freedom speech legal political system name public good 88 going run j funny beating rest usenet head stick ok universal anon acces somehow person side equation even arguing shut entirely
