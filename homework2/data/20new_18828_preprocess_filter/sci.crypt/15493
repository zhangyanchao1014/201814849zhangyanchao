mark subject list large integer arithmetic package thi file last updated april 1993 response email request assembled thi list arithmetic package heard c function library available source form ymy convenience placed copy available anonymou ftp directory however may current version case particular order mp multiple precision package come unix multiple precision package accessed vium flag ymy compiler provide come suno next mach mach 1000 probably see man mp object code course cohen et al pari france multiple precision desk calculator library routine contain assembly code motorola code sparc apparently rather slow generic c version integer real vector matrix well contain number advanced function ive never heard function ha function test related stuff plenty tex documentation public domain cant distribute modified version available vium anonymou ftp seem mac version addition filename arithmetic global field kevin r david r grant package routine arbitrary precision integer finite field include basic like source code c distributed term gnu public license include man page tex documentation filename arbitrary precision math library lloyd lo ca c package support basic provide point ie posted october 1988 filename j france distributed digital equipment pari research lab portable efficient integer package c code generic c kernel plu assembly kernel intel mip course vax thi probably one package thi type implement mod plu logical operation xor signed arithmetic available available vium email receive 5 shell archive give ymy postal addres also receive printed documentation france package include tex documentation publicly available noncommercial use removed thi archive heard rumor doesnt like distribute however distributed part see package portable integer package written entirely c include mod testing random number generator package wa tried add enough comment get thi package actually used work well portable havent done benchmark code look clever accomplished number unlike package thi one require allocate storage problem ymy number really huge ha placed code public domain filename improved version package thi one signed arithmetic dynamic allocation turned option ha new routine contain minor filename bmp brent multiple precision r p brent 1981 fortran code extended precision floating fixed point arithmetic include mathematical function youd find fortran runtime library thi code acm algorithm number obtain send mail message containing line send bmp better yet perhap start help joseph dec thi huge prototype public key authentication system based rsa mention heard probably correctly guessed contain large integer package want inform large integer package contain indeed dec france get betum test copy use testing may expire certain date dont know whether thi ha yet amp multiple precision multiple precision integer package c include mod mod random available noncommercial use package include public key system based algorithm thi normally part wellknown removed de part avoid deal cryptographic export law named result filename per u c routine class generic arithmetic integer rational formerly available however seem disappeared sorry someone ireland integer multiple precision package include testing encryption public domain apparently available austin code work see ad byte magazine dr precision dave multiple precision integer package c rand mod log simple vector support dynamic allocation memory free long dont sell program use filename prof university 3 tokyo japan version basic programming language msdo include floating point said keith pretty fast object think say thi best package know fast arithmetic ha version 386 machine include routine fastest currently known general algorithm additional file site allow use hard drife factor 80 digit many number theoretical function included allows 2500 digit precision available vium anonymou ftp wuarchivewustledu unknown msdo language allows infinite precision nice intrinsic function report problem changing precision fly see simtel20 keith turbo pascal 5 source routine rand integer also include rand rational number filename institute dr schneider fast c subroutine library dont know anything say contact info postal addres institute 29 germany marku multus precision arithmetic written time critical part written assembler include basic arithmetic well arithmetic number additional module provide collection procedure testing package part privacy enhanced mail pem package include pem mailer rsa key generator generation tool source c assembler sun 3 ha also ported msdo logitech turbo assembler availability free university use research education otherwise source license required obtain write email marku 7 switzerland email package written portable c future conform common lisp function handle integer currently include comparison random number filename gnu multiple precision gnu free software foundation multiple precision package havent looked yet thi current april 1992 may recent version time read thi thi package widely available ftp site filename curve proving france large package prove prime include package obtained filename pgp pretty good privacy philip crypto package include routine c said quite fast intel processor unix mac version also available crypto package violate rsa patent routine used without fear legal bell arbitrary precision calculator david bell australium calculator good online help language many builtin function support integer rational number work like floating point complex number matrix string list file object include testing even function recommended large package though obtained filename builtin support language variou multiple precision arithmetic available number programming language lisp abc cf larry wall available include source package probably suitable seriou use source code may available thi list long enough im going pursue thank ed several contributed thi list mark
