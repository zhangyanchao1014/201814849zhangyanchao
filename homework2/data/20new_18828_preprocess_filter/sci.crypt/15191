independent panel cryptography expert evaluate algorithm assure potential user entirely open public examination trusted beside prove device used examination one built ymy phone q whose decision wa propose thi product national security council justice department nsa fbi q wa consulted congres industry ongoing discussion congres industry encryption issue expect discussion carry review encryption policy briefed member congres industry leader decision related thi initiative forget q government provide hardware manufacturer government designed developed key acces encryption microcircuit
