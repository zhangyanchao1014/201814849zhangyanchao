john kelsey subject clipper considered harmful clipper chip user key formed r3 used gain effective increase defeat potential use 80 bit key knowing anything skipjack algorithm really possible gues whether thi make harder easier gues n1 formed would see skipjack algorithm look way attacking require three ciphertext block formed odd way constant value serial number form come changed chip chip session session even theyre published ny time skipjack resistant attack using triple encryption break security allow kind weird format three value bit maybe used ensure attack skipjack exist cant easily used derive s1 s2 whole production run chip dorothy denning read thi group someone group question like martin anyone else seen detail chip john kelsey
