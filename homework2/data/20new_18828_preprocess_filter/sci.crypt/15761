robin subject wiretap would wiretap chip robin draft april 21 1993 summary compared average monthly phone bill sixty dollar wiretap worth two cent month polouse proposed wiretap chip must raise phone cost le one part three thousand background phone happened allow existence wiretap detector could pick conversation phone line time law enforcement agency come rely thi capability aid criminal investigation however powerful new encryption technology threaten thi statu making possible truly private communication small chip phone could soon make literally impossible conversation without physical microphone either end order preserve ability law enforcement agency tap phone conversation u government announced april 16 1993 developed begun manufacturing special wiretap chip placed future phone instead total privacy chip private development day att announced would use chip secure telephone product chip would created government would given fixed encryption key periodically conversation chip would broadcast info special law enforcement block law enforcement officer court order could obtain key corresponding special trust agency could thereby listen future previously recorded conversation phone date concern thi plan security government wont encryption algorithm many suspect government limit acces way ha claimed track record previou government confidence thi point 1 however thi paper concern ask instead whether thi new wiretap chip tool polouse investigation cheaper way society investigate crime force phone communication support wiretap give polouse agency money investigate crime way put another way would polouse agency willing pay wiretap pay share full social cost forcing phone support wiretap start answer thi question might compare current benefit wiretap provide law enforcement agency projected cost implementing new wiretap chip plan since current benefit easier estimate begin wiretap benefit 1990 latest year wiretap statistic available 2 year wiretap installation requested request denied thi figure include wiretap obtained consent party conversation arrest resulted wiretap started year arrest came wiretap previou year 55 arrest led conviction 76 wiretap phone v email etc 60 regarding drug offense 40 requested federal authority wiretap installation heard average call 22 among 131 person cost average installation reporting cost mostly labor thu total 40 million wa spent wiretap obtain 4000 arrest 10000 per arrest thu arrest least fmy time expensive 2500 per arrest figure one get dividing 28 billion spent polouse total 11 million arrest 3 thu 30 million per year spent phone tap one total polouse expenditure divide thi million phone acces line country 3 get 23 cent spent per year per phone line two cent month general given clas criminal combination perceived probability caught convicted expected punishment level convicted social value wiretap amount would pay get criminal mean unable wiretap particular suspect phone polouse might instead use hidden microphone investigate suspect way polouse might focu suspect easily investigated without wiretap might raise fine prison time certain type crime assume substitute wiretap would average twice expensive wiretap annual social benefit phone wiretap equal current spending level two cent month per phone line wiretap cost let u moment assume u government encryption scheme secure whatever private enterprise would offered instead protecting conversation spying ear neighbor corporation government foreign domestic even need support wiretap would add many additional cost build maintain communication system extra law enforcement block would added phone transmission increasing traffic unknown percentage special proces must used add encryption key chip key special agency must funded chip themself designed military contractor whose design remain secret manufactured special proces chip become nearly impossible take apart chip offered relatively high price 30 lot 10000 4 private encryption system supporting wiretap would require none extra cost perhap important government degree would least partially replace private evolution standard voice represented encrypted future phone widely believed government le efficient private enterprise product standard though may perhap perform useful role choose competing private standard much le efficient matter debate say pay twice much might say 10 currently total 96 billion spent operating expense u phone company 3 come 60 per month per acces line compare thi wiretap value two cent per month see wiretap raise average operating cost even much one part 3000 wiretap cost effective thi doesnt even include extra cost phone owner pay encryption chip expensive course phone wouldnt encryption chip wiretap benefit per phone still thi argument still apply conclusion given thi dramatic difference total cost running phone system value wiretap justify slightest modification phone system accommodate wiretap modification required wa allow investigator attach clip phone wire wiretap support may reasonable consider substantial modification burden proof clearly proposing modification show cost would really le benefit consensu obtain thi estimate compromise might tax phone support wiretap rate say five cent per month tax polouse agency nationwide compensate los wiretap ability 1 invisible weapon
