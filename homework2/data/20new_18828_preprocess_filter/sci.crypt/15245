proposed perfect compression followed simple encryption method eg xor repeated key unfortunately compres perfectly know exact distribution possible input practical purpose impossible describe typical english text beyond characteristic frequency build sophisticated model ymy input enemy ha slightly accurate model hell able find ymy compressed output note nearly practical compression scheme unles designed cryptography mind produce output actually start high example output unix compres begin wellknown magic number serve entering cryptanalysi thi say compression encryption inherently bad idea ha done carefully mean remove need strong encryption compression encryption silly unbreakable cipher ye pad unbreakable see part 4 unfortunately pad require secure distribution much key material plaintext course cryptosystem need utterly unbreakable useful rather need strong enough resist attack likely enemy whatever length time datum protect expected remain valid random mean cryptography cryptographic application demand much number generator application source bit random must impossible predict nth random bit given complete knowledge algorithm hardware generating stream sequence bit n lifetime source software generator also known ha function truly random seed longer string apparently random bit thi seed must large enough guessed opponent ideally also truly random perhap generated hardware random number source sparcstation 1 workstation could example generate random number using audio input device source entropy connecting anything example cat compres foo gife file high entropy random much one encrypt file using part key example convert seed entropy string looking hardware device provide thi entropy important really measure entropy rather assume look complicated human must random example disk operation time sound like might many person disk much like clock output time relatively low entropy point aka distance see distance amount ciphertext sum real information entropy corresponding source text encryption key equal number ciphertext bit used ciphertext significantly longer thi shown probably unique thi used back claim validity cryptanalysi ciphertext significantly shorter thi likely multiple equally valid decryption therefore gain security opponent difficulty choosing correct one distance like statistical measure make prediction rather gife result namely minimum amount ciphertext likely single plaintext corresponding ciphertext possible key tried decryption working dont normally deal distance instead directly determine likelihood event interest let distance cipher character fewer ciphertext character enough information distinguish real key set possible key de ha distance 175 character le 3 ciphertext block block correspond 8 ascius character thi may seem low first distance gife indication computational work required find key approximately character fact actual cryptanalysi seldom proceed along line used discussing distance like measure key size distance something guarantee small doesnt guarantee security high practical cryptosystem absolutely analysi manner characteristic might serve entering crack cipher message however similar consideration occasionally useful example determine recommended key change interval particular cryptosystem also employ variety statistical test help guide analysi promising direction unfortunately literature application information statistic cryptanalysi remain classified even 1940 work alan see insight possibility see key management important one fundamental axiom cryptography enemy full possession detail general cryptographic system lack specific key datum employed encryption course one would assume cium make habit telling cryptosystem probably find anyway repeated use finite amount key provide eventually facilitate progress thu especially modern communication system vast amount information transferred party must sound cryptosystem also enough key material cover traffic key

problem publickey system several related issue many trust use number key stream equation fractal produce apparent relatively compact generator perhap simplest example linear sequence one popular type random number generator obviou seed output unfortunately graph sequence high enough dimension show regular thi correspond structure easy exploit complicated generator complicated structure make interesting picture strong sequence structure see exercise 357 correct frequency list english letter three answer thi question slightly deeper one find first answer variou book namely frequency list directly certain sample english text course list correctly exactly list get depend sample wa taken second answer question doesnt make sense mean english letter english language fixed finite closed object exactly characterized ha changed time different different author particular message different statistic language whole third answer ye particular message going exactly characteristic english general reasonable statistical use slight wont matter fact entire field called statistic maximum entropy method maximum likelihood study question like chance text letter frequency english come reasonably robust answer make ymy list ymy sample english text good enough practical work use properly project datum security looking source information german code wa broken british wwius see card
