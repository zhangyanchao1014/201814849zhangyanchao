john kelsey subject pad authentication think couple way pad scheme though im sure prove kind provide obviou might truly random eve block message calculate included random starting block message thi could encrypted message problem im sure impossible come message hash regardles random starting block seem like ought hard im sure clearly hash like md5 would stronger im sure im comfortable claiming unbreakable scheme use pad bit decide many bit 0 include plaintext stream going wouldnt bad either cost increasing speed use ymy pad thi could used give low probability ymy opponent could message since plaintext spot carrying 0 show something funny going message bit mi used one random bit ru decide whether insert 0 plaintext stream wed get total pad use 25 time message length wed expand message size half 0 appear plaintext stream doesnt gues bit ha gues im trying see chance making way message get little complicated get un still happen 0 place message see simple way thi got secure pad cost using 4 time message length pad bit message bit mi use one random bit ru xor together get encrypt three bit pad enemy ha way guessing ru heshe cant gues either change make ciphertext stream involve gues ru wa way thi without using many pad bit message equivalent correctly guessing many random bit bit message clearly thi make message hard know whole message text know none fact look like thi make hard generate message ciphertext without im entirely sure easier way thi secure pad john kelsey
