bryan olson g subject advanced one time pad wa one time pad stuff ok youve read thi group know question havent seen ideal security ha wellknown flaw authentication suppose use random bit stream pad encryption operation know plaintext message change message work alouse sending bob plaintext p key stream alouse compute ciphertext c xor p send bob eve know p want message appear p eve intercept c compute c c xor p xor p xor p eve send c bob bob decrypt c computing p thu receiving false message wa eve question thi attack defeated information security computational security define something like ideal authentication analog ideal security obtain ideal authentication much limit eve control message achieve ideal authentication solution use key bit expand message show solution one parameter anyone know question
