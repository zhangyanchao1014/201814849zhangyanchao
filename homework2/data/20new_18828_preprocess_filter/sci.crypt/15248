cryptology cryptography plaintext ciphertext encryption key reference start learn cryptology one go cryptanalysi search cryptographic relevance property satisfied every strong cryptosystem cryptosystem theoretically unbreakable guaranteed practice many person still using cryptosystem relatively easy break cryptology cryptography plaintext ciphertext encryption key story begin sent message hi trusted acquaintance didnt trust messenger replaced every c every b someone knew shift 2 rule could hi message cryptosystem cipher system method message certain person see cryptography art creating using cryptosystem cryptanalysi art breaking even youre supposed able cryptology study cryptography cryptanalysi original message called plaintext disguised message called ciphertext encryption mean procedure convert plaintext ciphertext decryption mean procedure convert ciphertext plaintext cryptosystem usually whole collection algorithm algorithm label called key instance probably used shift n encryption several different value n natural say n key person supposed able see called recipient person enemy opponent third party reference start learn cryptology introduction technical matter survey article given part 10 best place begin general concise competent person well written however article mostly concerned cryptology ha developed last 50 year abstract mathematical historical history technical detail cryptology cryptanalysi learned thi recommended especially person want encryption algorithm since common mistake try make system knowing break one selection algorithm de drew attention many public researcher problem cryptology consequently several textbook book serve text appeared book denning gife good introduction broad range security including encryption algorithm database security acces control formal model security similar comment apply book price book meyer quite technical book meyer directly involved development de book give thorough analysi de book quite mathematical detailed many classical cryptosystem meyer concentrate modern cryptographic method especially pertaining key management integration security facility computer system network book concentrate application number theory cryptography one go cryptanalysi classical cryptanalysi involf interesting combination reasoning application mathematical tool pattern finding patience determination luck best available textbook subject military series clear cryptanalysi part gained attempted solution given system experience considered valuable performed wwius ally still classified modern publickey cryptanalysi may consist integer taking discrete traditional computational number successful public key system search cryptographic relevance know compute f find x trying every possible x search example say ha found plaintext corresponding ciphertext doesnt know key simply try encrypting plaintext using possible key ciphertext ciphertext match plaintext whichever faster every cryptosystem ha large key space thi search advance technology sometime change considered practical example de ha use 10 year ha 256 possible key computation thi many operation wa certainly unlikely user situation different today given dramatic decrease cost per processor operation parallel machine threaten security de brute force search scenario described one phase sophisticated cryptanalysi may involve search small space possibility property satisfied every strong cryptosystem security strong system secrecy key rather attempt keep algorithm secret strong cryptosystem ha large mentioned distance measure gife minimum amount ciphertext must identify key key distance much longer amount ciphertext intend encrypt key system probably strong strong cryptosystem certainly produce ciphertext appear random standard statistical test see example strong cryptosystem resist known previou attack system ha never subjected scrutiny suspect system pas test mentioned necessarily strong certainly many weak cryptosystem looked good first however sometime possible show cryptosystem strong mathematical proof joe break thi system also solve wellknown difficult problem integer see part 6 failing crap shoot cryptosystem theoretically unbreakable guaranteed practice method include known practical cryptanalysi enemy doesnt ymy ciphertext figure plaintext instance might assume probable plaintext correct might able key rest message might exploit plaintext several cryptosystem several key thu might obtain solution even theory say doesnt chance sometime cryptosystem pad example losis security used even attack enemy somehow feed plaintext key employed see many person still using cryptosystem relatively easy break dont know better often amateur think design secure system aware expert could sometime motivation anybody invest work needed crack system
