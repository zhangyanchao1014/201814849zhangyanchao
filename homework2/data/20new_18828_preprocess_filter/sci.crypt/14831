marc subject ripem frequently asked question archivename 31 mar 93 0500 thi posting thi listing likely question information ripem program public key mail encryption thi faq ripem wa written maintained marc posted variety newsgroup monthly basi followup discussion specific ripem group new running world wide web archive ripem information contain much anything isnt available elsewhere ha convenient pointer current version thi faq stuff thi month version ha fair amount new pointer information patent stuff like ive also thing sensible ordering hope dont edit thi soon disclaimer nothing thi faq considered legal advice anything one opinion want real legal advice talk real lawyer preferably one experience patent law export regulation whatever area law question list question 1 ripem 2 get ripem 3 ripem run machine 4 ripem work mailer 5 rsa 6 de 7 like md5 8 pem 9 thi key 10 isnt bad idea use patented algorithm standard like pem 11 12 ripem public key look similar 13 pgp 14 15 16 17 thi simple way defeat security ripem question answer 1 ripem ripem yet complete useful implementation privacy enhanced mail pem ripem allows ymy electronic mail fmy security facility provided pem disclosure protection optional message integrity measure origin alway see pem ripem wa written primarily mark code public domain except rsa routine library called licensed rsa datum security inc current version ripem 105 current version macintosh port ripem 07 2 get ripem ripem use library cryptographic routine considered thu distribution person citizen permanent resident u canada without export license license ha obtained would one likely granted unles rsa key exchange 512 bit symmetric cipher changed something de suggestion thi situation may change clinton office author request readme file thi law violated please export cryptographic code thi distribution outside usa canada thi personal request author ripem condition ymy use ripem note public domain license included distribution read using ripem ripem available vium anonymou ftp citizen permanent resident u cd read readme file info note portion ripem product rsa datum security incorporated merely helping distribute ripem well stuff ha home site open ftp user u canada citizen permanent resident find obtain acces ftp cd read file convenience binary many architecture available addition full source tree 3 ripem run machine probably ha already ported msdo flavor unix suno next linux aix ultrix solari etc port macintosh include standard port rather nice port written raymond lau author stuffit port expected help user invited 4 ripem work mailer probably easy clean effective interface depend mailer though user guide included distribution discus way use ripem many popular mailer including berkeley mh code also included allow easy use ripem inside gnu emac make new interface ripem create improvement one distribution believe convenient use secure may useful feel free post 5 rsa rsa crypto system publickey thi mean two different related key one encrypt one decrypt one reasonably derived may publish ymy encryption public key widely keep ymy decryption private key anyone use ymy public key encrypt message hold private key needed decrypt note message sent rsa normally de key real plaintext see de note provide disclosure protection message integrity origin service implemented message see like md5 encrypted sender private key recipient authority use sender public key decrypt confirm message must come sender wa altered rsa wa named three man shamir invented find lot rsa modern cryptography general ftp look information also may scicrypt 6 de de datum encryption standard widely used symmetric crypto system unlike rsa de use key encrypt decrypt message however de much faster rsa ripem use de rsa generate random key encrypt ymy mail de using key encrypt key recipient public rsa key include result letter allowing recipient recover de key de sometime considered weak somewhat old use key length considered short modern standard however reasonably safe opponent smaller large corporation government agency likely pem standard incorporate support symmetric cipher near future strong feeling pem stable become widely without early problem 7 like md5 md5 message digest algorithm produced rsa datum security inc provide secure hash plaintext secure possible reasonable amount computation produce different plaintext produce thu instead signing entire message sender private key md5 message need signed authentication md5 also directly authentication example ripem public key include md5 public key file party confirm key authentic vium separate channel merely need exchange md5 key verify accuracy md5 sometime used purpose example often used map input arbitrary length 128 bit datum interpreter cookie generator md5 described including implementation c rfc recent suggestion md5 may strong hash wa originally believed presumably hash function used thi accepted true 8 pem pem privacy enhanced mail standard allowing transfer encrypted electronic mail generated long period time working group expert described rfc document approved obsolete old rfc ripem really complete implementation pem pem specify key ripem handle thi time addition planned 9 thi key remote user able send secure mail must know ymy public key able confirm message received came must know public key important thi information accurate bad guy convince hi key fact send message read ripem allows three method key management central server distributed finger server flat file three described ripem user guide part distribution none provide perfect security pem standard call key management addition thi feature ripem planned issue still exist 10 isnt bad idea use patented algorithm standard like pem thi issue ha considered standard proces rfc specification internet standard ha discussion section 6 specification availability must met patented method included standard rfc address thi issue regard patent covering publickey cryptography thi course mean question settled everyone agreement interesting exchange use patented algorithm standard regard publickey cryptography league programming freedom archive available vium ftp file file compressed patented algorithm 11 rsa datum security inc company cryptographic technology public key partner firm hold exclusive right following u patent corresponding foreign patent cryptographic method public key cryptographic method cryptographic communication system method rsa cryptographic method claim fmy patent cover known method public key cryptography two business rather closely related example person jim president ha licensed thi technology considerable number company ibm dec motorola att lotu use product ha also threatened filed lawsuit defending patent ripem wa originally created connection use library reason author desire see widespread use publickey cryptography however ball started rolling person got interested decided carry ripem ftp site person started making ripem key contributing code ripem even best application built 1992 award 12 ripem public key look similar ripem public key begin publickey cryptography standard describing variou characteristic key first bunch character ymy key may lot people key thi mean ymy key similar clas key generated program length etc 13 pgp pgp another cryptographic mail program called pretty good privacy pgp ha around longer ripem work somewhat differently pgp compatible ripem way though pgp also use rsa major difference pgp ripem pgp ha key management feature particularly user without direct network connection ripem conform pem rfc thu ha greater probability working pem software pgp make attempt compatible anything ripem use library rsa routine come license allowing noncommercial use pgp use implementation rsa claim violation patent make use sell pgp u canada without either license written permission see disclaimer see phil author pgp stopped threatened legal action believed licensing scheme could arranged hasnt happened seem little prospect happening future acknowledge pgp user guide fact live usa federal agency shouldnt actually run pgp ymy computer public key partner want forbid running software pgp pgp ripem sent outside u canada without export license however pgp already exist many ftp site europe place whether use pgp ripem whatever documentation pgp recommended reading anyone interested issue unfortunately distributed separately program difficult find u ftp site due liability concern 14 stand rabin privacy enhanced mail wa similar ripem used publickey cipher invented rabin rsa attempt avoid patent publickey system wa written mark later wrote ripem distribution wa contrary belief many including rabin claimed patent broad enough cover cipher employed thi claim universally accepted wa challenged reason really used anymore compatible ripem pgp 15 stand internet mail extension described rfc find newsgroup faq exist pem interact yet entirely clear person use solution type order send ripem message one hope standard emerge draft internet document exist matter 16 trusted information system working version privacy enhanced mail general availability last heard wa integrated existing mail user agent mh rather system betum test dont know much 17 thi simple way defeat security ripem may wish check companion post discus obviou attack ripem security procedure minimize risk ripem main weak area probably key distribution
