dave butler subject new biblical contradiction still answered juda mr decenso spite requiring scholarly opinion hanging juda reject scholarly opinion scholar scholar opinion subject know matthew hang act probably record hi death although possible plausible fell hanging hit rock thereby open longer assume case therefore contradiction matthew say juda died result hanging scholar believe quoted show highly regard scholar explanation looking text initially cant assume juda died however highly probable also nothing greek suggest succes failure simply mean hang oneself actually research greek word find denote succes scholar indeed excellent reason assume suicide wa successful pointed recently checked several greek english new testament robinson greek english new testament greek english new testament word study greek english new testament early christian writing new greek couple simply stated hanged oneself couple explicit stated mean specifically kill hanging couple also noted meaning one root word throttle choke pretty much guy suggested david juda wa hung one best reference though robinson greek english new testament stated translation gave root word literal translation related greek word use root also presented specific example word greek literature give context word ha two root word root root word mean literally away thi root word included word denote transition mean transition place eg greek word mean send message also denote change state specifically change life death robinson specifically make comparison word mean kill literal meaning word mean throttle put way denote change life state ie away life death word mean hang specifically denote death well thu robinson quite specific state mean hang oneself end one life hanging note use homer denote context present example used explicitly mean suicide hanging since perfectly good word without added death insist bible wa written god every word correct stuck complete meaning ie since word wa used death result way note mr decenso also present example septuagint greek translation ot used time jesu used 2 samuel saw hi advice wa followed arose went home hi house hi city put hi household order hanged died wa buried hi father tomb notice stated hanged gr sept explicitly add died doubt result matthew explicitly told juda died note mr decenso say septuagint wa translation hebrew greek shown original meaning hebrew ie hebrew say died thu whether wa simply greek also pointed regardles added died correct translation would still man indeed die correct evidence septuagint wa repeatedly included version editing wa even necessarily executed greek thu sure use septuagint stand ancient greek really need prove ymy point mr decenso example ancient greek someone committing surviving otherwise would see simply making worthles assertion without corresponding evidence would note mr decenso everytime go way research one ymy apparently pretty much find false thu think going add text something source clearly say better explicit greek historical source justify way mr rose statement tree around field still tree around rocky bottom unles mr rose show tree two thousand year old 2000 year old ha 2 thousand year old description area mention tree inappropriate assert present tree prove location tree two thousand year ago thing change ymy argument ie money juda used 30 silver ymy second question mr decenso ask could sure money juda purchased land wa indeed rather source would point act specifically mention reward iniquity act 118 also specifically mention act iniquity talking ie act 116 concerning juda wa guide arrested jesu would point bible describe act iniquity immediately discus reward iniquity would rather suggest wa action iniquity one discussed notice verse 16 word iniquity used rather state juda became guide arrested jesu writer stop 17 wa u obtained part thi ministry part juda play ministry true peter author act specifically call juda iniquity matter neither john specifically call juda action iniquity either john say juda took money box rather said thought juda money box jesu wa telling buy need give something poor receiving immediately went wa night note said juda left say took money box thu see ymy explanation still seem would choose iniquity mentioned another author different book written different time iniquity explicitly mentioned author act find thi forced course thi particular argument become since seen evidence mean suicide see since juda hanging wa successful could spent money mentioned john matthew mark explicitly say wa high holy day ie passover thu could spent money killing next day thu money bought field blood would 30 piece silver course got 30 piece silver night well thu couldnt spent either oh dear believe house card maybe thi point discus whether jesu wa friday saturday part argument juda way prophesy field came ie mention matthew say please done thi study hi death remind discus thi discus part verse discussing wish would quit issue later dave butler wise man proportion hi belief evidence david philosopher inquiry concerning human understanding p would note stating bible possibly stating since ymy admission presenting merely possible course dont rate highly best say bible possibly
