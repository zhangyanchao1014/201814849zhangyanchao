david veal write well ye federalist paper propaganda therefore difficult determine precisely etc couple way look one want support thi constitution well say anything think appeal straightforward thi think weve suggested thi constitution good idea clearly consider former primary situation point make pain point may new interest also want raise opposition basing principle horror popular principle perhap question whether constitution might written appeal principle rather appear believe wa written something else mind propoganda put supporter let honest something wa last time brought valid point ymy argument simply cant know phill really mean obviously using argument designed convince well know hamilton wa probably extreme jefferson democratic would suggest mean determining opinion government dont consider wrote government dont propose mean exist determining true opinion thu true opinion died little help today opinion slightest bearing matter though argument true false regardles said theyre true false said earth make point calling would seem difficulty u poster seem considering argument may flawed longer apply modern society oh argument questioning dont believe longer apply think good argument im entirely happy situation obviously applied minority time dont think alone sufficient alive today one opinion could count upon man expres careful study mechanism government necessary ongoing improvement required gave opinion certain area proved right area got wrong wa mechanism improve thi happen willingnes accept problem within u political system may require constitutional change solution since u constitution basi u political system change would require constitutional change thi particular case however matter procedure tradition made part constitution senate wa le powerful house lord wed almost state house representative wa also fact british government much greater power american system principle practice ye principle le power le power british government today dependent convention seeking exercise power prime minister able identify politic national interest manner u president regularly phill power legislative house prime minister member parliament although badly u president please explain u house representative principle powerful house lord senate practice le suggesting writer constitution really intended powerful darn thing wa realized theyd forgotten put extra restriction senate disagree system slow wa simply designed handle le ha demanded handle somebody washington put whose name forget congres ha become everybody city council one reason every level government rendered unable come decision decision pushed next higher level instead entry level political science course tell person want law implemented alway choose level government attack present best chance getting want national interest group simply rational thing want federal government law rather state le person persuade le contribution make concerned abortion primarily concentrate federal level simply win battle little state battlefield extension extend insurance medicine question local government ha failed hasnt done dominated local interest thu interest want rule cant get rule past local government thu since theyve got wrong place appeal next higher level impose lower mean let get real really need united state deciding x light thu pattern need federal opposed local crime person want congres take power sell vote dont think rise special interest coincidence increased power congres congres capable quick action ha enough power time hand original wa allowed local autonomy start social welfare model instead current state motto would better placed plenty state money handed problem distributed basi power congres basi actual need higher governmental le actual need matter political power concentrated higher level person le cloud find themself reduced effectivenes order set school project new york state pay 49 state pork defense contract agricultural etc precise 30 state since need 60 beat simply leave new york education new york remain state union capable child want leave worry pork state since industry cant concentrate political power wealth rather must divide among state try get want individual voice relative impact problem must buy state congres ha acquired much power sell pork case system government created failing operating set condition specifically wanted avoid namely concentration power would seem proper thing reduce power either house attempt wheel youll get system move quicker stupid thing would make sense make decision local level break machine free seizure redirect earth want redirect said sell pork get thing congres ha le authority sell pork retain authority national legislation within granted jurisdiction pork problem significantly reduced current block power simply congres responsibility come decision current block essentially state action thu system action considering government usually institution sole power enforce decision force consider bia making decision good thing pushing decision lower wont work unles lower level le corrupt case worse better difference lower legal legitimate authority matter constitution federal government b lower level power harder concentrate c get benefit new everybody get see tried without national decision congressional action usually treat entire country whole yet even similar problem different area different solution may called often dont agree decision local state rep make least better option going city council shooting mouth id much rather majority law made accessible person hang around end put rather somebody far washington half million im curiou base ymy assumption lower level corrupt fail see restriction implied otherwise placed veto could easily read mean put check popular executive opinion policy since arguing federalist paper would point phill brought federalist paper arguing whether minority senator allowed hold bill claimed senate wa suppose far le powerful house wa nothing constitution writing indicated thi wa brought cant decide founder wanted based federalist paper argued never argued primarily referred constitution place small restriction senate house u constitution gife almost reasoning work part reason given right bear arm well regulated militium justification u constitution document independence wa reasoning couple example though reasoning power tax reasoning power grant permit article section 8 veto wa meant measure follow fact senate president wa meant legislation would three chamber two furthermore separation power would much le distinct certain extend believe veto ha become something wasnt intended however also believe inevitable considering congres abuse power make bill say whatever want say unlike person think shouldnt veto fine problem congres almost abuse limit constitution president veto power regarding bill previou president used veto number reason usually something agenda really curiou single bush president abused veto ha record veto bush phill absurd bush 37 veto one wa go read think anything record reasonable restriction 51 senator magic holy number upon law must based 41 senator feel safe enough state stand isnt enough indicate sufficient question whether law good idea point fact though majority opposed minority minority allowed win default inherently wrong system action historically action u dealing issue bare minority large minority successful youre position federal power diverse person federal government got something bare majority one earth 51 sufficient law cover 250 million person diverse place living different condition shouldnt required bill issue money bill relating short term proposal switching general question specific bill dont see make difference change law favmy statu sure theyre arguing however requiring 60 bring vote ensure theyll good argument something isnt based solely party line system simple majority given absolute power ignore minority minority ignored see thi positive thing im sure republican looking pork much democrat theyve got legitimate objection legislation question instead consider system minority automatically win superior completely happy system require minority action since u history history population group implementing minority feel minority prevent action feel strongly enough 41 hardly tiny minority dont advocate minority capable see problem federal system action david veal univ tenn div cont education info service group pa146008utkvm1utkedu still remember way laughed day ymy pushed elevator shaft im
