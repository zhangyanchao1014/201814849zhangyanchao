quack like domain case really domain case contract domain transaction one party required sell piece property another party regardles whether first party wish sell price set state fail see thi doctrine found contract case general well okay sort since court supposed busines preventing party settlement party settlement arise act party since said boomer economic led result im pointing ymy alternative far traditional sense world atlantic cement act wa something society want build factory create industry job cost compliance wa damage faced plaintiff bang one place widely believe court deciding civil dispute two party consider factor perhap factor issue believe court ignore irrelevant dispute boomer v atlantic cement co wa action brought one party boomer whose property right violated ongoing basi another party atlantic cement company fact supported boomer contention atlantic cement wa damaging hi property boomer asked court order atlantic cement stop end story wa reason court consider issue society would want atlantic cement whether cost compliance wa damage faced plaintiff issue nothing case court bill government epa made regulation requiring dollar cement plant shut cement dust ratio 151 youd arm okay judicial branch interfere thi way legislative executive branch id arm assume quite contrary id probably support action since would based general doctrine decision believe would correct boomer idea people property right violated reason economic efficiency boomer wa boomer property right believe court protected hypothetical epa ruling youve presented american people collective property right healthy physical environment good ratio 151 wind cement dust ymy air ymy rule make per se illegal ever operate cement plant state massachusett came similar regulation youd arm complaining interference property right fifth amendment violation okay judicial branch interfere thi way legislative executive branch libertarian present ted frank would per se illegal operate cement plant wouldnt mean buying land cement plant would either buy enough land pollution would stay ymy land buy pollution surrounding tim smith take one hundred neighbor plant furthermore neighbor going want full benefit resulting monopoly lawyer sure get negotiate agreement away profit plant would make particularly good society ye court supposed protect specific right individual general interest society society cement plant without violating anyone right fine otherwise society somehow along one le cement plant see ted really libertarian whole point behind world without transaction cost land automatically put best use transferred person person without legal regime matter result world one transaction cost one want legal regime approximate end result begin order minimize transaction cost one want legal regime approximate end result begin order minimize transaction cost one speaking want legal regime protect people right beside ha real application land perfectly rational real world 1 person going otherwise irrational economic point view 2 purpose court protect right dont care show logically ymy 100 damage property per head sell right land say 150 per head still retain right tell plain dont want damned property price say everyone property right protected plaintiff made whole unnecessary settlement cost avoided dispute ymy claim plaintiff made whole fact court action deprived right owner property choose sell sell property price acceptable ymy argument plaintiff ever made whole award damage treat plaintiff different plaintiff dont require specific performance analogou situation last question first reason contract law would come close amendment ymy ymy argument plaintiff ever made whole award damage claim youre least partially right faced situation wrong ha already done damage victim ha already taken place reversed court try set price tag los suffered victim require pay thi price rather inflated price victim might prefer case sale ha already taken place court simply try ensure fair price paid doctrine certain circumstance even civil forced pay excessive price b even genuine victim profit manner hi doctrine may worth discussing debating elsewhere neither relevant case like boomer act los still future ie prevented happening order court type case court ha require potential victim property right protected unles agree sell price need court gues value los force side accept finding leave operation party themself ask since court supposed busines unnecessary settlement cost avoided ive alway thought court supposed busines justice done unnecessary settlement cost case like boomer theyre simply cost busines fact atlantic cement co got themself position found themself thi barrel simply result poor busines decision start cement plant without first trying negotiate boomer everyone else whose property right theyd violating vium operation plant nothing 2 completely sensible believe alleged right owner atlantic cement stay busines avoid losing lot money due act alleged right several hundred atlantic cement employee job disappear right person property wa damaged atlantic cement act anybody ever commit act entire set possession person werent complaining exces damage anybody want commit act future required buy right victim advance seller allowed set hi price privilege injustice damage youd like bill libertarian really didnt know anything ha say case like boomer cite example monopoly court correctly avoided im sure covered book law presumably dont book front doesnt sound much like libertarian libertarian tend believe right individual person society ive admitted understanding field generally referred law economic weak advocate use analysi one many factor court may use help reach decision case dispute measured scale justice balanced fine boomer fine court start viewing economic case important justice case thi case justice case wa tied economic case atlantic cement committed causing damage pay million compensate damage committed stated wa ongoing atlantic cement wanted able continue violate boomer right court may justified setting price tag damage already committed reason need set price tag future violation boomer right force boomer sell price william december starr
