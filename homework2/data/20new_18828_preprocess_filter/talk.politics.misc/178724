either saw thank article matt said like call form government advocate fractal fractal representative national government ha certain limited power absolutely necessary level next state government absolutely necessary power county district neighborhood 1 lowest read local level one power individual life good level individual voice know take thi logical conclusion doesnt seem real lowest level level individual voice single individual themself omitted level ymy model ye individual omitted didnt fully principle fractal government power derive person level receive new power level amendment proces true consensu say 34 majority write power constitution level case lowest level passed 34 majority vote case higher level must passed 34 course specific true consensu hold constitutional convention power ha granted may power original constitution must starting individual proces original constitution involve consensu simply majority right constitution course government level restrict activity government lower level operate way amendment proces crazy u government structure thi government structure one person read liberal would like concentrated power use government force person good word one difficult reach consensu also structure want use government dictate personal behavior read conservative personally would rather see type person frustrated incredible liberty civil economic going thi imho good government see role government protection individual liberty still individual need influence type community live 2 free market work government economic idea idea die ymy definition successful idea successful government one maintain peace liberty opportunity happiness person working within reality human nature bring point intentional lasting idea mean necessarily successful idea believe fractal would least bring many idea light person would opportunity choose good idea bad idea er mean democrat right government foster person local opportunity check thesi possible arise balanced conservative republic received best level government activity become clear person best far set moral tone concerned community want put going front kid community want see drug among kid reason put church operating right open kid see owner house acros street flying american flag right open every day front kid called freedom dont like idea kid exposed try educate persuade kid thing theyre seeing person wrong bad right person would freedom read government except amendment proces federal government supposed work supreme soviet er mean supreme court put stop republican government nonsense hypothetical government constitutional provision government regulate church government whatever level talking could indeed ban church constitutional provision would invalid higher level constitutional provision protecting free exercise religion constitution still supreme law land find interesting idea competition among variou idea yet support right majority community suppres idea dont like matter individual able control association environment matter idea one human condition individual need liberty also need control environment fractal government certain right protected constitution right protected simply government ha upon consensu reached government certain power freedom infringed upon thi avoided murder statute upon freedom think consensu american person murder statute good idea sure many parent believe right control environment child live person feel right sleep peacefully night thu noise law keep business neighborhood view bad thing certainly individual instance bad concept necessarily bad view person community control type community live see alternative near anarchy like said another post come scenario individual something truly absolutely zero effect anyone else individual government ha right restrict activity simply many behavior fit category truly whole thing become issue one individual group power another individual group think fractal approach sound ideal approach limiting thi power libertarian scenario might make right system right one lawyer natural right philosophy decide power government democratic proces though supreme court problem view try deny fundamental democratic government person right exercise voice community yet individual right left themself thi seriou precisely much take place vacuum enough say taken literally little conflict person indeed right exercise voice voice equal speech community somehow get idea head also right dictate behavior community trouble begin think answered thi already let expand little example stand naked front ymy house front ymy child play ymy libertarian small l scenario value judgement time scientific reality clear definition exactly would make value judgement stuff deleted certainly cause mike person local neighborhood voice go neighborhood deny thi create another concentrated power keep power essence using pit bull keep toy ymy leg chance pit bull going turn day much le defense toy argument appear tyranny individual local majority superior federal government exercise power protect individual hi neighbor federal government eventually inevitably become corrupt use power everyone okay lot truth certainly seeing something like happening united state today though unclear progression match model since beloved federal government hasnt much idea protecting individual lot person long complaint short practical solution although idea ever bear fruit least trying long solution also truly interested improvement make idea call idea come average guy reading u constitution without benefit constitutional law say think ymy solution least bad trading federal tyranny local tyranny doesnt cheer much think id prefer put faith larger government least might protect individual time time rather place local mob rule admittedly lesser two evil le much theyre pretty damn evil sorry confusion wa fault said fractal resemble u constitution meant thought wa pretty clear clearly explained ultimate government power consensu person although consent every individual practical observation moral judgement certainly better government power derive nine lawyer situation think supreme court jury court different jury case certainly perfect philosophy government still find idea ymy solution ideally everyone would leave everyone else alone government power kind would necessary thi never work person different nature alway want force view thi case nobody would try force view murder wrong anyone else thi true question going ymy proposed solution seem actually encourage lord victim think misunderstood structure form government advocate wa fault clear oh way thinking irrelevant integrity irrelevant free speech irrelevant private property irrelevant personal responsibility irrelevant much would freedom speech private property right respected community majority wa allowed make rule man saying thing public dont want child exposed let shut living together house let run em town majority make rule majority possibly simply elect representative exercise limited government power limited government power derive large consensu simple majority federal government scenario still ha power protect freedom william december starr matt thinking irrelevant integrity irrelevant free speech irrelevant private property irrelevant personal responsibility irrelevant opinion employer
