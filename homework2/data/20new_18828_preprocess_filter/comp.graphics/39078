tom lane subject jpeg image compression frequently asked question archivename lastmodified 2 may 1993 thi faq article discus jpeg image compression suggestion addition clarification welcome new since version 18 april 1993 new version xv support 24bit viewing x window new version image alchemy new version image os2 new listing thi article include following section 1 jpeg 2 use jpeg 3 use jpeg stick gif 4 well jpeg compres image 5 good quality setting jpeg 6 get jpeg software software viewer etc source code 7 thi color quantization 8 jpeg work 9 lossles jpeg 10 argument file format 11 recognize

separate line dont get reply server may ymy return addres add line path specify ymy correct email addres reply 1 jpeg jpeg image compression mechanism jpeg stand joint expert group original name committee wrote standard jpeg designed either fullcolor grayscale digital image natural scene work well image line drawing jpeg handle image handle motion picture compression standard type image worked committee named mpeg respectively jpeg meaning image get isnt quite identical originally put algorithm achieve much compression known limitation human eye fact small color detail arent perceived well small detail thu jpeg intended image looked human plan ymy image small error introduced jpeg may problem even invisible eye useful property jpeg degree adjusting compression parameter thi mean image maker trade file size output image quality make extremely small file dont mind poor quality thi useful image archive making view icon etc etc arent happy output quality default compression setting jack quality satisfied accept lesser compression 2 use jpeg two good reason make ymy image file smaller store color datum instead datum making image file smaller big win file acros network library image able compres 2 mbyte fullcolor file 100 make big difference disk space transmission time comparing gif jpeg size ratio like fmy one detail ymy viewing software doesnt support jpeg directly youll convert jpeg format viewing image even viewer take longer decode view jpeg image view image simpler format gif instance thu using jpeg essentially give time order store transmit image cheaply worth noting network phone transmission involved time saving transferring shorter file much greater extra time decompres file ill let arithmetic reason jpeg gradually replace gif standard usenet posting format jpeg store full color information 24 16 million color instead 8 le 256 fewer color 8bit display hardware thi may seem like much advantage within couple year though 8bit gif look obsolete format today furthermore reason detailed section 7 jpeg far useful gif image among person widely varying color display hardware hence jpeg considerably appropriate gif use usenet posting standard 3 use jpeg stick gif jpeg going gif entirely type image gif superior image quality file size one first thing learn jpeg kind image apply rule thumb jpeg superior gif fullcolor grayscale image realistic scene mean scanned photograph similar material jpeg superior even dont 24bit display hardware lot superior see section 7 detail gif significantly better image distinct color line drawing particular large area pixel exactly color compressed efficiently indeed gif jpeg cant squeeze file much gif without visible defect thi sort image best kept gif form particular border quite cheap gif file avoided jpeg file jpeg also ha hard time sharp edge row pixel row pixel example sharp edge tend come unles use high quality setting thi sort thing found scanned photograph show fairly often gif file border text etc particularly text pixel high gif lot text dont jpeg image scene instance usually fall scanned image term complexity complex rendered image likely jpeg well go fantasy drawing plain two level image never converted jpeg need least 16 gray level jpeg useful grayscale image also noted gif lossles grayscale image 256 level jpeg existing library gif image may wonder whether convert jpeg lose little image quality section 7 argue jpeg image quality superior gif apply format start fullcolor original start gif youve already lost great deal information jpeg make thing worse however disk space saving may justify converting anyway thi decision youll make convert gif library jpeg see section 14 hint prepared leave image gif format since gif convert well 4 well jpeg compres image pretty darn well sample file size image handy fullcolor image ship first three file comparison purpose rest created free jpeg software described section file size byte comment original file ppm format compression 24 bit 3 byte per pixel plu byte overhead ppm file passed unix compres compres doesnt accomplish lot youll note compressor give similar result converted gif f 256 saving result losing color info gif save 8 24 see sec 7 q 95 highest useful quality setting thi 24bit original least q 75 default setting look mighty darn close distinguish thi original even q 50 thi ha slight defect know look could tell without seeing original still good image quality many recent posting usenet picture group q 25 jpeg characteristic become apparent thi setting help still ive seen plenty usenet posting image quality thi q 5 cut table overhead perfectly satisfactory preview purpose note thi file tiny compression ratio original thi case jpeg make file factor fmy five smaller gif comparable quality q 75 file every bit good gif better fullcolor display thi seem typical ratio scene 5 good quality setting jpeg jpeg compressor let pick file size v image quality quality setting seem widespread confusion meaning setting quality 95 mean keep 95 information claimed quality scale purely arbitrary percentage anything name game using jpeg pick lowest quality setting smallest file size image original thi setting vary one image another one observer another rule thumb default quality setting q 75 often best choice thi setting lowest go without expecting see defect typical image try q 75 first see defect go except experimental purpose never go q 95 saying q 100 produce file two three time large q 95 hardly better quality image wa le perfect quality begin might able go q 50 without degradation hand might need go higher quality setting avoid degradation second case seem apply much time converting gif jpeg default q 75 right 24bit image q 85 95 usually better converting gif see section 14 info want small file say preview purpose prepared tolerate large defect q setting range 5 10 right q 2 may amusing op art note quality setting discussed thi article apply free jpeg

organization youd like contribute improving software welcome join 7 thi color quantization person dont fullcolor 24 bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware store 8 fewer bit per pixel display 256 fewer distinct color time display fullcolor image computer must map image appropriate set representative color thi proces called color quantization thi something color selection would better term stuck standard usage though clearly color quantization proces turn image detail color quantization algorithm much impact final image quality error introduced jpeg except lowest jpeg quality setting since jpeg fullcolor format converting color jpeg image display hardware require color quantization thi true color jpeg even feed gif jpeg come 256 color thousand color thi happen jpeg affect pixel little differently two pixel started identical color probably come slightly different color original color get group nearby color therefore quantization alway required display color jpeg display regardles image source way avoid quantization ask grayscale output incidentally thi effect nearly meaningles talk number color used jpeg image even attempted count number distinct pixel value different jpeg decoder would give different result error difference occasionally see posted image described jpeg thi tell poster hasnt read thi faq b probably converted jpeg gif jpeg classified color grayscale like photograph number color isnt useful concept jpeg hand gif image definition ha already 256 fewer color gif definite number color palette format doesnt allow 256 palette entry purpose usenet picture distribution gif ha advantage sender color quantization recipient dont thi also disadvantage gif youre stuck sender quantization sender different number color display resulting much image quality fullcolor image furthermore sender didnt use color quantization algorithm youre luck thi reason jpeg offer promise significantly better image quality user whose machine dont match sender display hardware jpeg full color image precisely match user display hardware furthermore able take advantage future improvement quantization algorithm lot active research thi area purchase better display hardware get better view jpeg image already gif youre stuck wa sent also worth mentioning many program include rather quantization routine view gif ega display example probably getting much worse image need thi partly inevitable consequence two color quantization one create gif one display often also due jpeg conversion program forced use high quality order get acceptable result normal use directly number color displayed thu jpeg likely provide better result average gif program display well one finally number person display hardware already hicolor pc display true 24bit display workstation macintosh etc person gif already obsolete represent image full capability display jpeg image drive display much effectively thu jpeg better choice gif representing image fashion 8 jpeg work know discrete transform quantization arithmetic entropy coding thi article long enough already im going say technical information see faq thi available newsanswer archive rtfmmitedu file need help using newsanswer archive see top thi article 9 lossles jpeg great deal confusion thi subject jpeg committee define truly lossles compression algorithm ie one guarantee final output identical original input however thi lossles mode ha almost nothing common regular jpeg algorithm offer much le compression present implementation lossles jpeg exist commercial saying q 100 free jpeg software get lossles image get rid deliberate information los quantization step still good deal information los color step v4 free jpeg code also say sample turn keep mind many commercial jpeg implementation cope resulting file even quantization turned regular jpeg algorithm lossles subject error variou calculation maximum error count one pixel value highly unlikely thi could perceived human eye might concern machine processing image thi setting regular jpeg produce file perhap half size image true lossles jpeg provide roughly amount compression guarantee accuracy application requiring lossles storage image le 6 bit per pixel per color component may want look image compression standard thi perform better jpeg lossles image jpeg lossles superior image 6 bit per pixel furthermore jpeg public domain least back end technique heavily covered patent 10 argument file format strictly speaking jpeg refer family compression algorithm refer specific image file format jpeg committee wa prevented defining file format war within international standard organization since cant actually exchange image anyone else unles agree common file format thi leaf u problem absence official standard number jpeg program writer gone thing result program arent compatible anybody else closest thing standard jpeg format work person microsystem defined two file format jfif jpeg file format format transport pixel much else aka tiff 60 extension tiff format tiff highend format let record everything ever wanted know image lot beside tiff lot complex jfif may well prove le different vendor historically implemented slightly different incompatible subset tiff likely adding jpeg mix anything improve thi situation format developed input major vendor product reasonably likely future commercial product one standard believe usenet adopt jfif replacement gif picture posting jfif simpler tiff available tiff 60 spec ha recently officially adopted still vague crucial detail even well defined jfif format likely widely supported lowest common file may never particular case person may interested apple quicktime software macintosh quicktime use format wrapped inside structure conversion jfif quicktime jpeg pretty straightforward several mac program available see mac portion section editor handle binary file strip quicktime jpeg jfif hand see section 11 detail another particular case software program image alchemy program capable reading writing jfif format default though write proprietary format developed thi format readable program used usenet posting use j switch get jfif output thi apply old version program current release emit jfif format default still careful post file unles want get flamed person platform 11 recognize file format alleged jpeg file ymy software wont read likely format proprietary format tell first byte file 1 file start character hex followed two variable byte often hex 00 10 followed jfif 2 see start rest may raw jpeg file thi probably jfif software worth try anyway 3 file start youre luck unles software portion file may look like plain jpeg datum wont decompres properly program 4 macintosh file couple hundred byte header followed jfif header scan jfif strip everything able read 5 anything else proprietary format jpeg lucky file may consist header raw jpeg datum stream identify start jpeg datum stream look try everything uuencoded usenet posting characteristic jfif pattern begin line wherea uuencoded file start begin line mi learn check former save trouble file 12 arithmetic coding jpeg spec define two different back end module final output compressed datum either coding arithmetic coding allowed choice ha impact image quality arithmetic coding usually produce smaller compressed file typical image arithmetic coding produce file 5 10 percent smaller coding number previously cited coding unfortunately particular variant arithmetic coding specified jpeg standard subject patent owned ibm att mitsubishi thu legally use arithmetic coding unles obtain license company fair use doctrine allows person implement test algorithm actually image dubiou best least short run recommend person worry arithmetic coding space saving isnt great enough justify potential legal hassle particular arithmetic coding used image usenet small chance legal situation may change future stay tuned detail 13 los repeated would nice compressed image jpeg could decompres manipulate crop border say without image degradation beyond lost initially unfortunately thi case general altered image losis information though usually much wa lost first time around next best thing would decompres image without changing los ie get identical jpeg file even thi true least current free jpeg software essentially problem error repeatedly compres decompres image eventually degrade see visible change output usually take many cycle get visible change one thing list see error avoided limited case could possibly guaranteed would fullcolor output original quality setting would introduce los even simple change border could cause degradation youre wondering boundary move multiple 16 pixel might safe mighty limited capability bottom line jpeg useful format storage transmission image dont want use intermediate format sequence image manipulation step use lossles format ppm rle tiff etc working image jpeg ready file away aside avoiding degradation save lot time thi way 14 rule thumb converting gif image jpeg stated earlier lose amount image information convert existing gif image jpeg obtain original fullcolor datum gif wa made far better make jpeg need save space gif work suggestion getting maximum space saving minimum los quality first rule converting gif library look jpeg make sure happy throwing away corresponding gif give chance conversion higher quality setting necessary gif may better left gif explained section 3 particular gif fewer color dont convert well may find jpeg file reasonable quality larger gif check size experience date suggest large gif best candidate conversion jpeg storage offer potential saving convert jpeg least degradation dont waste ymy time converting gif much 100 also dont expect jpeg file converted gif small created directly fullcolor original maintain image quality may let converted file much twice big jpeg file would ie shoot 12 size gif file 14th suggested earlier comparison many person developed odd habit putting large border around gif image useles thi wa nearly free term storage cost gif file free jpeg file sharp border boundary create visible ghost edge favor crop border x window system xv manual automatic function way thi default q setting 75 appropriate fullcolor input gif input q setting 85 95 often seem necessary avoid image degradation apply smoothing suggested higher q setting may necessary color gif photograph complex usually fool ymy eye seeing 256 color gif actually store image see pixel often significantly different color normal size eye average pixel together produce illusion intermediate color value trouble jpeg look like color noise jpeg cant compres noise well resulting jpeg file larger lower image quality would gotten original full color image get around thi want smooth gif image compression smoothing average together nearby pixel thu color thought saw anyway proces getting rid rapid color change give jpeg trouble appropriate use smoothing often let avoid using high q factor thu reducing size compressed file still obtaining output image youd get without smoothing v4 free jpeg software product based simple smoothing capability built try smooth 10 converting gif value 10 25 seem work well gif may require larger smoothing factor see regular pattern gif image even without strong smoothing definitely called large smoothing factor output image dont want image processing wizard also smoothing separate filtering program pbmplu package however builtin lot faster thi quality 85 smooth 10 probably good starting point converting gif really care image youll want check result maybe try setting information jpeg general free jpeg software particular contact independent jpeg group tom lane organizer independent jpeg group internet bitnet
