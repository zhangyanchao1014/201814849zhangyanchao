bell subject surface normal orientation stephen write go normal direction given set point edge face thi algorithm work well algorithm attempt find normal first mark face unknown create edge dictionary allows find face sharing given edge edge two integer representing two shared vertex pick arbitrary face mark using edge dictionary surrounding face based orientation thi face surrounding face consistently entire surface find average vertex thi surface using point calculate volume measurement taking account face orientation volume turn positive assume face oriented correctly negative reverse orientation mark face still unknown thi choose another face go algorithm end face marked must index reversed normal found note running silicon graphic machine buy iri 3d toolkit developer package source thi algorithm see youre sorry cant give source even could rely heavily
