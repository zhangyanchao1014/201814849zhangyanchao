n subject looking job software engineer sure supposed post thi mail however last year wa involved developing graphical user interface gui application enjoyed personally part thi news group got interesting information helped work posting hoping person working area would make time look hall isu ame ia april 29 1992 dear employer seeking employment software engineer interest software design development utilize experience hardware c c programming graphical user interface gui operating system computer networking received engineering degree electronic engineering 1990 degree electrical engineering dec 1992 iowa state university currently computer engineering iowa state university master program research assistant since jan 1991 published three paper including one ieee transaction magnetic paper reflection quality research ability learn new concept quickly involved many project involving software development extensive experience programming c c fortran assembly level also familiar operating system like unix ultrix msdo familiar programming currently research assistant involved graphical user interface gui design using gui toolkit xvt experience also include area operating system computer network course work project wa involved study design development internal operating system also involved many tcpip programming project computer networking college importance clear concise communication also learned lot time management program maintained grade average worked 20 hour per week enjoyed involved many extra activity software experience along hardware background electronic engineering would helpful career goal software engineer request qualification may kindly reviewed would like interview discus ymy employment need career goal eager hear soon sincerely sn resume n work residence isu hall isu ame ia ame ia email objective obtain position software engineer involving software design development utilize experience hardware c c programming graphical user
