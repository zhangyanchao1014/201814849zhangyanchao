steve subject sphere 4 point edward write boy thi trivial faq given 4 point non one find sphere center radiu exactly fitting point know circle 3 point immediately see straightforward way 3d checked geometry book graphic gem still los please mercy provide solution bad question dont ref list thi algorithm either thinking bit shouldnt hard 1 take three point find plane define well circle lie say thi algorithm already 2 find center thi circle line passing thi center plane three point pas center sphere 3 repeat point two original point thi gife two different line pa sphere origin center sphere 4 radiu easy compute distance center original point ill leave math thi algorithm alternate method would take pair point plane formed line segment pair also contain center sphere three pair form three plane point thi might easier implement steve
