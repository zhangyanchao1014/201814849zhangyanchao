alan subject sphere 4 point steve write edward write boy thi trivial faq given 4 point non one find sphere center radiu exactly fitting point know circle 3 point immediately see straightforward way 3d checked geometry book graphic gem still los please mercy provide solution bad question dont ref list thi algorithm either thinking bit shouldnt hard 1 take three point find plane define well circle lie say thi algorithm already 2 find center thi circle line passing thi center plane three point pas center sphere 3 repeat point two original point thi gife two different line pa sphere origin center sphere 4 radiu easy compute distance center original point ill leave math thi algorithm good bad feeling thi problem special case solution worried fmy point shape square unique sphere surface similarly 4 point finite sized sphere surface algorithm designed rather design meet problem determining plane 3 point algorithm return infinite r two line 2 possibility line 4 point circle different line parallel sphere radiu thi last case achieved 3 point 4th point taking 4th point pair first 3 parallel line produced also achieved 4 point one circle seem algorithm fail 4 point algorithm alway fail point 4 point testing 4th point plane first 3 point ha found trivial alternate method would take pair point plane formed line segment pair also contain center sphere three pair form three plane point thi might easier implement steve
