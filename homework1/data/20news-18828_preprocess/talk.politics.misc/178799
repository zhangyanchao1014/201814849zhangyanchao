first reason contract law would come dangerously close treading thirteenth amendment ymy ymy argument tort plaintiff ever made whole award damage involuntary claim youre least partially right faced situation wrong ha already done damage victim ha already taken place reversed undone court try set equitable price tag los suffered victim require wrongdoer pay thi price rather inflated price victim might prefer case sale ha already taken place irreversible court simply try ensure fair price paid doctrine certain circumstance even civil wrongdoer forced pay punitive excessive price b even genuine victim profit unjustified inequitable manner hi victimhood doctrine may worth discussing debating elsewhere neither relevant case like boomer wrongful act los stemming still future reversedundone ie prevented happening order court type case court ha require potential victim property right protected unles agree sell mutuallyacceptable price need court gues equitable value los force side accept
