convention monarch seeking exercise power deposed subtly prime minister able identify politic national interest manner u president regularly phill discusing power legislative house prime minister member parliament analgou although badly u president please explain u house representative principle powerful house lord senate practice le suggesting writer constitution really intended powerful gosh darn thing wa ratified realized theyd forgotten put extra restriction senate disagree system slow wa simply designed handle le ha demanded handle somebody washington put whose name forget congres ha become everybody city council one reason every level government rendered unable come decision decision pushed next higher level instead entry level political science course tell person want law implemented alway choose level government attack present best chance getting want national interest group simply rational thing want federal government enact law rather state le person persuade le contribution make concerned abortion primarily concentrate federal level simply win battle little state battlefield extension extend insurance medicine question local government ha failed hasnt done dominated local interest thu nonlocal interest want locality abide rule cant get rule past local government thu since theyve got clout wrong place appeal next higher level impose lower mean let get real really need congre united state deciding x traffice light thu pattern carjacking need federal opposed local crime person want congres take power sell vote dont think rise special interest coincidence increased power congres congres capable quick action ha enough power time hand confined original jurisidiction wa allowed local autonomy start social welfare model instead current state subsidy motto would better placed plenty state money handed problem distributed basi power congres basi actual need bingo higher governmental ladder le actual need matter political power concentrated higher level person le cloud find themself reduced effectivenes order set school project new york state pay 49 state pork defense contract agricultural subsidy etc precise 30 state since need 60 beat filibuster simply leave new york education new york remain unconcinved state union capable educating child want leave worry pork state since industry cant concentrate political power wealth rather must divide among state try get want individual voice relative impact problem fillibuster must buy state congres ha acquired much power sell pork case system government created failing operating set condition specifically wanted avoid namely concentration power would seem proper thing reduce power either house attempt grease wheel youll get system move quicker stupid thing would make sense make decision local level break machine free seizure redirect earth want redirect said sell pork get thing congres congre ha le authority sell pork retain authority enact national legislation within granted jurisdiction pork problem significantly reduced current block power simply absolve congres responsibility come decision current block essentially state inaction preferable action thu system weighted action considering government usually institution sole power enforce decision force consider bia making decision good thing pushing decision lower pyramid wont work unles lower level le corrupt case worse better difference lower pyramid legal legitimate authority matter constitution federal government b lower level power harder concentrate c get benefit imposing new deicison everybody get see tried without national decision congressional action usually treat entire country whole yet even similar problem different area different solution may called often dont agree decision local state rep make least better option going city council shooting mouth id much rather majority law made accessible person hang around end put rather somebody far washington half million constituent im curiou base ymy assumption lower level corrupt fail see restriction implied otherwise placed veto could easily read mean put check democratically popular unwise executive opinion policy since arguing federalist paper would point phill brought federalist paper arguing fillibuster whether minority senator allowed hold bill claimed senate wa suppose far le powerful house contended wa nothing constitution writing indicated thi wa brought cant decide founder wanted based federalist paper argued never argued primarily referred constitution place small restriction senate house u constitution gife almost reasoning work part reason given right bear arm ammendment well regulated militium justification ambiguou u constitution nutsandbolt document delcaration independence wa highbrow reasoning couple example though reasoning power tax reasoning power grant permit article section 8 veto wa meant exceptional measure follow fact senate president wa meant revise legislation would three chamber legislature two furthermore separation power would much le distinct certain extend believe veto ha become something wasnt intended however also believe inevitable considering congres abuse power make bill say whatever want say unlike person think shouldnt worrying veto fine problem congres almost necessitate abuse limit constitution president veto power regarding bill previou president used veto number reason usually something agenda really curiou single bush president abused veto ha record veto bush phill absurd bush 37 veto one wa overridden go read fdr think anything resembling record reasonable restriction 51 senator magic holy number upon law must based 41 senator feel safe enough state constituency stand fillibuster isnt enough indicate sufficient question whether law good idea reevaluate point fact though majority opposed minority minority allowed win default inherently wrong biasing system action historically governemnt action u dealing issue bare minority large minority successful youre position imposing federal power diverse person federal government got something bare majority one earth 51 sufficient enact law cover 250 million person diverse place living radically different condition shouldnt supermajority required bill issue money bill relating short term proposal switching general question fillibuster specific bill dont see make difference change law presupposition favmy statu quo arguable sure arguable theyre arguing however requiring 60 bring vote ensure theyll good argument something isnt based solely party line system simple majority given absolute power ignore minority minority ignored see thi positive thing im sure republican looking pork much democrat theyve got legitimate objection legislation question instead consider system minority automatically win superior completely happy system require minority action since u history history carving population group implementing piecemeal minority feel minority sufficent clout prevent action feel strongly enough 41 hardly tiny minority dont advocate minority capable initiating actionm see problem biasing federal system action david veal univ tenn div cont
