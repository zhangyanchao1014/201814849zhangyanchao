guykuocarsonuwashingtonedu guy kuo subject quadra clock modification long modified quadra 700 higher speed previously using variable speed overdrive accelerating cpu thi modification testing stable higher speed ymy mileage may vary top speed achieve predicted hand personal q700 ha tested fine 32 mhz thu far didnt higher speed clock oscillator hand test higher speed part clock oscillator 4 pin ttl variety need selection speed beginning 50 mhz cpu run 12 oscillator speed original one 50 mhz unit recommend getting 50 mhz clock case damage existing one obtained clock oscillator digikey 18003444539 le 500 part number 50 mhz ttl clock oscillator part x121 62 mhz ttl clock oscillator part x136 66 mhz ttl clock oscillator part ctx137 dont get half size clock oscillator wont fit also cmo clock oscillator havent tried one quadra work fine iisi socket obtain 4 pin socket form factor 14 pin dip package alternatively use 4 machined socket pin augat style socket cut socket cooling fan small 12 volt fan keep cpu cool must vso came specially modified heatsink fan built onto passthrough connector tapped hard drive power cable rig something similar risk frying ymy cpu procedure 1 insert usual disclaimer antistatic warning 2 remove top lid machine see floppy disk hard drive mounted plastic tower follow usual antistatic precaution course make sure machine thi unplug cable wall monitor power supply cord back mac 3 remove power supply pulling plastic interlocking tab tower forward simultaneously pulling power supply straight tab piece plastic left posterior aspect tower extend downward hook power supply may also feel horseshoe shaped piece right portion power supply leave alone plastic tab tower need release 4 look rear tower assembly see flat ribbon scsi connector hard drive power cable flat ribbon cable leading floppy drive disconnect motherboard hard drive power cable connector ha tab must squeezed release 5 unplug drive activity led clear plastic mount 6 look posterior cylindrical section plastic tower phillip head screw base remove taking care drop case bit gummy glue ymy screwdriver helpful 7 remove tower assembly pulling medially plastic tab right side tower thi tab prevent tower sliding posteriorly slide entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly lift tower assembly straight case 8 remove interrupt switch assembly strangely shaped plastic device left front edge motherboard pull middle rear plastic prong forward entire device release 9 unplug speaker cable squeeze plastic tab speaker free swing backward free case 10 remove motherboard form case lift front right corner motherboard 1 mm thi allows clear clear plastic power light guide slide motherboard forward 1 cm motherboard come directly 11 locate 50 mhz clock crystal small metal box near cpu chip note remember orientation new clock oscillator must aligned pin 1 orientation carefully desolder remove old clock oscillator pin may bent simply desolder unbend sure ymy desoldering iron hot enough heating board used suction desoldering iron accomplish thi task thi appropriate first soldering experience motherboard multilayer design fine trace easily damaged without proper care 12 install ymy socket socket pin old oscillator wa 13 put 50 mhz clock oscillator new socket could use old clock ha solder pin thi may come inside socket cause corrosion problem later suggest using new 50 mhz clock 14 install ymy cooling fan system complete modification 14 reinsert motherboard slide place 15 snap interrupt switch assembly speaker lock mother board firmly plug speaker wire back motherboard 16 reinstall tower assembly first placing right wall tower right wall case tower assembly 1 cm posterior intended position lower tower assembly place maintaining contact right wall case fully slide tower assembly anteriorly click place 17 reconnect motherboard end cable dontt forget floppy drive cable 18 replace phillip head screw 19 drop power supply straight place click 20 plug hard drive activity light back clear plastic mount 21 reattach ymy cable power cord cro ymy finger turn mac make usual power chord doesnt something amis immediately turn power recheck ymy handiwork well sincere condolence hopefully work normally turn machine back replace 50 mhz clock oscillator faster one reboot astounded need fully test machine many hour deciding particular speed truly usable vso machine lockup might take 8 hour operation occur brief time since modifying clock oscillator 36 hour single problem good luck attempt thi modification small real risk could well reach quadra 950 speed higher le 50 part guy kuo guykuouwashingtonedu
