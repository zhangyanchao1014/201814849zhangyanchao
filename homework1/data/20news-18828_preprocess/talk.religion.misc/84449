retired engineer chemical electrical wa 91 year old died may 1989 bachelor science degree engineering science oregon state university developed hi comprehensive general unified theory physical universe trying develop way compute chemical property based element used larson lack fancy phd degree might one reason orthodox physicist ignoring valid reason sometime take relative outsider clearly see forest tree time clear hi book also knew orthodox physic astronomy well physicist astronomer well enough point contradiction ad hoc assumption principle impotence inconsistency etc larson fund etc experimentally test hi theory wa necessary simply compared variou part hi theory researcher experimental observational datum many case hi explanation fit better selfconsistent theory much orthodox physicist astronomer claim looking unified field theory work ignoring one 30 year modern physic explain physical universe well part larson book full quotation leading orthodox physicist astronomer agree remember epicycle crystal sphere geocentricity flat earth theory etc also seemed explain well later proved conceptually wrong prof frank h meyer professor emeritu uwsuperior wasi strong proponent larson theory wa still president larson organization international society unified science editor quarterly journal reciprocity moved minneapoli retiring super collider boondoggle contruction superconducting super collider texa anywhere else would gros waste money contribute almost nothing scientific value physicist dont realize according comprehensive general unified theory late physicist dewey b larson described hi book strange goofy particle meson hyperon alleged quark etc finding existing collider fermi lab cern etc really atom antimatter created highenergy colliding beam quickly disintegrate like cosmic ray incompatible environment larger expensive collider create element antimatter physicist seen physicist even confused type antimatter atom worth 83 billion cost dont much important use thi wasted money another thing consider primary proposed location texa ha seriou growing problem kind fire ant eating insulation underground cable much poisoning ground ground water insecticide required keep ant supercollider naming super collider ronald reagon proposed totally absurd built named leading particle physicist larsonian antimatter larson comprehensive general unified theory physical universe antimatter simple case opposite charge type particle ha rate vibration rotation photon made relation vibrational rotational equivalent speed light larson call unit velocity natural datum larson theory positron actually particle matter antimatter positron electron meet rotational vibration charge rotation respective photon made neutralize larson theory antimatter half physical universe ha three dimension time one dimension space exist reciprocal relationship material half larsonian relativity perihelion point orbit planet mercury ha observed precisely measured advance rate 574 second arc per century 531 second thi advance attributed vium calculation gravitational perturbation planet venu earth jupiter etc remaining 43 second arc used help prove einstein general theory relativity late physicist dewey b larson achieved result closer 43 second general relativity instead using special relativity one hi book applied lorentz transformation high orbital speed mercury larson totally rejected general relativity another mathematical fantasy also rejected special relativity including part increase near speed light use lorentz transform doppler shift quasar redshift greater 1000 really moving faster speed light although motion away u time larson comprehensive general unified theory physical universe three dimension time instead one two dimension measured material half physical universe one dimension measure clock time low relative speed value two dimension negligible high speed become significant lorentz transformation must used fudge factor larson often used term coordinate time writing thi regard increase ha proven atomic accelerator acceleration drop toward zero near speed light formula acceleration acceleration force fm orthodox physicist ignoring third factor force larson theory stay constant force drop toward zero force actually motion combination motion relation motion including inward outward scalar motion expansion universe example outward scalar motion inherent universe result socalled big bang yet another mathematical fantasy universe motion wish recommend everyone book universe motion dewey b larson 1984 north pacific publisher po box 13255 portland oregon 97213 456 page indexed hardcover contain astrophysical portion general unified theory physical universe developed author unrecognized geniu thirty year ago contain final solution astrophysical mystery including formation galaxy binary multiple star system solar system true origin 3degree background radiation cosmic ray gamma ray burst true nature quasar pulsar white dwarf exploding galaxy etc contain astronomer astrophysicist looking ready seriously consider open mind following example hi theory succes hi first book 1959 structure physical universe larson predicted existence exploding galaxy several year astronomer started finding necessary consequence larson comprehensive theory quasar discovered immediate related explanation also gammaray burst astrophysicist astronomer still scratching head mysteriou gammaray burst originally thought originate neutron star disc galaxy new gamma ray telescope earth orbit ha detecting direction uniformly source location space correspond known object except case directional coincidence gammaray burst necessary consequence general unified theory physical universe developed late physicist dewey b larson according page 386 hi book universe motion published 1984 gammaray burst coming supernova explosion antimatter half physical universe larson call cosmic sector relationship antimatter material half physical universe way connected together gammaray burst pop material half anywhere space seemingly random thi source location burst correspond known object come direction uniformly wonder close u space source location would gammaray burst kill life earth would way predict one stop perhap extinction past blamed impact comet asteroid actually caused nearby gammaray burst larsonian binary star formation half star galaxy vicinity sun binary double orthodox astronomer astrophysicist still satisfactory theory form many binary star system actually likely consequence comprehensive general unified theory physical universe developed late physicist dewey b larson try summarize larson explanation detailed chapter 7 hi book universe motion hi book first according larson star generate energy fusion small fraction come slow gravitational collapse rest result complete annihilation heavy element heavier iron element ha destructive temperature limit heavier element lower thi limit star internal temperature increase grow vium accretion absorption decay product cosmic ray gradually reaching destructive temperature limit lighter lighter element internal temperature star reach destructive temperature limit iron type supernova explosion thi much iron present related structure iron atom atom building proces larson explain hi book better star explode lighter material outer portion star blown outward space le speed light heavier material center portion star wa already bouncing around close speed light high temperature explosion push material speed light expand outward time equivalent inward space often actually disappear long period time mass start fall back gravitationally material blown outward space start form red giant star material blown outward time start form white dwarf star star start moving back toward main sequence opposite direction hr diagram chance two mass falling back exact location space making single lone star near zero instead form binary system orbiting according larson white dwarf star ha inverse density gradient densest surface material center widely dispersed blown outward time thi eliminate need resort mathematical fantasy degenerate matter neutron star black hole etc larsonian solar system formation heavy material center exploding star relatively small instead single white dwarf star several mini white dwarf star revolving around red giant star probably still far away threedimensional time affected heat etc become planet chapter 7 universe motion larson used thi information principle hi comprehensive general unified theory physical universe derive hi version bode law black hole fantasy heard physicist stephen w hawking recently completed theoretical mathematical analysi two black hole merging together single black hole concluded new black hole would sum two original black hole result recognized everyone red flag causing widespread doubt whole idea black hole etc reading physicist dewey b larson book hi comprehensive general unified theory physical universe especially hi book universe motion clear black hole nothing mathematical fantasy strange object cygnu x1 unusually massive white dwarf star black hole orthodox astronomer physicist badly want prove theory way understand much publicity given physicist stephen hawking physicist astronomer seem acting hawking severe physical problem somehow make wiser wish attention given physicist dewey b larson wa still alive widespread publicity attention given larson theory book organization international society unified science electromagnetic propulsion heard concept many year ago connection ufo unorthodox inventor never wa able find work constructed found possible clue might work page 112113 book basic property matter late physicist dewey b larson describe part larson comprehensive general unified theory physical universe quote one paragraph indicated preceding chapter development theory universe motion arrife totally different concept nature electrical resistance electron find derived environment wa brought volume larson book nothing motion physical process operation produce electron substantial quantity although motion constitute electron many case absorbed atomic structure opportunity utilizing thi type motion structure limited follow alway large exces free electron material sector material half universe uncharged thi uncharged state electron move respect extension space inherently rotating unit space relation space space motion open space therefore uncharged electron remain permanently location respect natural reference system manner photon context stationary spatial reference system uncharged electron like photon carried outward speed light progression natural reference system material aggregate thu exposed flux electron similar continual bombardment photon radiation meanwhile process discussed later whereby electron returned environment electron population material aggregate earth therefore stabilize equilibrium level note larson theory uncharged electron also massles basically photon light particular frequency unit frequency spinning around one axi particular rate unit rate unit velocity speed light vibrational rotational equivalent speed light according larson theory might label mixed larson saying outer space filled le uncharged electron flying around speed light thi true electromagnetic propulsion field spacecraft might able interact electron particle space perhap giving charge shooting toward rear achieve propulsion larson theory electrical charge onedimensional rotational vibration particular frequency unit frequency superimposed rotation particle paragraph quoted might also give clue confused meteorologist lightning generated cloud suppression larsonian physic comprehensive general unified theory physical universe developed late physicist dewey b larson ha available 30 year published 1959 hi first book structure physical universe totally unscientific
