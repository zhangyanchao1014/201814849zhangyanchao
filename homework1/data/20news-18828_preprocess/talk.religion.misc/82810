reconciliation raised variou bible scholar student alike present view clearly distinguish db course without archer bullinger find mr decenso ha presented greek exegisi mr decenso ha made big thing referring back actual greek thu find thi demand hi part quality greek exegisi hypocritical requirement reply good point ymy declaring passage contradictory produced superficial reasoning observation dug deeper im glad begun thi post begin greek study passage depth thought necessary well db would appropriate look mr decenso ha actually used evidence know claim standard ha stated often enough text b parallel passage c pertinent scripture historical context e historical content f pertinent historical info g cultural context h cultural content pertinent cultural info j grammatical construction k hebrew greek word study l etc actual standard ha used simply empty hyperbole let see ha used since trying reconcile passage see ha also used b hand ha presented use historical context e historical content f pertinent historical info g cultural context h cultural content pertinent cultural info j grammatical construction even k hebrew greek word study remember archer bullinger dont count thu find hi vaunted criterium exegisi empty mouthing reply question find criterium important plan starting use best ymy ability continue present shallow observation dont mean thi bad way thi point debate found necessary present total exegetical analysi passage since seem keep beating around bush getting core verse believe necessary use many criterium refute ymy argument juda act matthew best thi point use several criterium since desire hope also greatly enhance study passage db thing ha actually used beyond passage passage thu mr decenso honest note hi list red herring hi real criterium seem text b parallel passage reply reason simpleyou mistating passage claim passage contradict one another see passage contradicting one another 1 may well complimentary many scholarly source mention 2 matthew may presenting juda death claim well look ymy defense thi later also reward iniquity act passage may 30 piece silver matthew passage although valiant attempt later stating believe thi beginning stage debate laying scriptural groundwork expanded upon deeper exegesi db course reason see drastically reinterpret passage ha done juda death make agree another passage could considered correct reply one reason given different exegetical view passage seem think majority scholarship wrong concluding passage complimentary however see problem tony rose explanation juda death would explain inaccuracy juda hanging matthew 275 falling headlong burst open thi question manner juda died one constantly confronted travel many person point apparent discrepancy two account obviou irreconcilable error gone far say idea inerrant bible destroyed contradictory account however thi case matthew relate juda hanged peter tell u fell wa crushed impact two statement indeed different necessarily contradict matthew say juda fall neither peter say juda hang thi matter one person calling something black person calling white account true supplementary possible reconstruction would thi juda hanged tree edge precipice overlooked valley hinnom hung time limb tree snapped rope gave way juda fell ledge mangling hi body proces fall could death either would fit thi explanation thi possibility entirely natural terrain valley hinnom examined bottom valley see rocky terrace 25 40 foot height almost perpendicular still tree around ledge rocky pavement bottom therefore easy conclude juda struck one jagged rock thi way tearing hi body open important remember told long juda remained hanging tree advanced wa decomposition hi body hi fall loui gaussen relate story man wa determined kill thi individual placed sill high window pointed pistol hi head pulled trigger leaped window time hand person could say thi man took hi life shooting another could rightly contend committed suicide jumping form tall building thi case true true case matthew peter account death juda merely situation different perspective event ymy reason rejecting thi believe ymy attempt discredit inerrancy havent related thi impossible highly unlikely said earlier post db quoting tony rose still tree around ledge rocky pavement bottom therefore easy conclude juda struck one jagged rock thi way tearing hi body open important remember told long juda remained hanging tree advanced wa decomposition hi body hi fall added text thi version heavy assuming truly opposed tactic find credible seem find tony rose eisegesi satisfactory clearly rejecting david joslin discredit tony explanation based deem heavy passage havent addressed feel way say vain attempt reconcile contradiction doesnt tell didnt happen shown reject possibility question matthew lying luke lying lying either misinformed think alleged contradiction think ever told u believe thi respect db present though mr decenso ask two question 1 claim act matthew contradict one another representing juda death ask provide evidence matthew stated juda died hanging 2 claim 30 piece silver matthew juda threw temple chief priest used reward iniquity act picture juda way purchasing field therefore contradiction prove 30 piece silver reward iniquity one actually find question 1 rather stupid request answer restrict two point first would point hanging efficient manner ending life fact bit fluke someone survife hanging except fantasy cowboy movie even usually referred attempted hanging reply work agency investigate child abuse neglect today got call child attempted suicide hanging hi mother crack failed hi attempt child psych ward local hospital hanging attempt alway successful assume hanging successful thi one wa also begging question may quote last night listening bible answer man broadcast christian research institute show one scholar used several term use familiar man bam show teach comparative religion logic wa interesting db thi prevalent say man hung qualifier synonymou stating killed reply qualifier important time well see ot passage ill mention hanging alway thi outcome matthew source juda hanging state juda died result say synonymou mean ha meaning boy age 14 hung lived thi one probably thousand documented case discover db alone thi thought fact since mr decenso respect christian scholarly including greek scholar opinion research reply thank dave db interestingly one christian reference read interpreted hanging anything fatal suicide reply mine ok use christian source back ymy point tony position value even consider valid possibility also possible source read may wrong lying deceived part book done archer tos side value anything say including interpretation hanging juda sure would find error maybe even deception source also noted interpreted hanging meaning died although possibly true find text remember first criterium must examine db thi included biblical knowledge commentary woodward zuck reply good source commentary info inerrant db interpreter volume commentary bible laydon one volume bible commentary j r dunelow word meaning testament ralph earl abingdon bible commentary published abingdon harper bible commentary william neal actually could presented many well reply appreciate ymy thi research dave maybe getting somewhere approach alleged contradiction depth study db case reference specifically describe interpretation matt 275 successful suicide thu conclude greek word apagchwie hang oneself translated successful hanging reply mine cant conclude thi although tony say thi wa highly probable outcome matthew state death result greek word apagcho matthew 275 occurrence new testament septuagint greek translation ot used time jesu used 2 samuel 1723 ahithophel saw hi advice wa followed saddled donkey arose went home hi house hi city put hi household order hanged died wa buried hi father tomb notice stated ahithophel hanged gr sept apagcho explicitly add died doubt result matthew explicitly told juda died also nothing greek suggest succes failure simply mean hang oneself db mr decenso welcome disagree show reputable christian scholar insist hanging wa successful reply mine reputable mean one never erred far insisting hanging wa unsuccessful cant done even said earlier post although still agree tony exegesi probable explanation regarding juda death taking account several criterium ive recently noticed new thing matthew mat 2758 threw piece silver temple departed went hanged chief priest took silver piece said lawful put treasury price blood consulted together bought potter field bury stranger therefore field ha called field blood thi day first notice text say juda died result hanging say went hanged luke however act tell u falling headlong burst open middle hi entrail gushed thi pretty clear indication along detail given act peter speech need pick new apostle etc least juda fall wa dead whole concept matthew luke recount juda death highly probable clear cut also wrote reply stickler dave say recently noticed let look passage matthew mat 274 saying sinned betraying innocent blood said u see mat 275 threw piece silver temple departed went hanged mat 276 chief priest took silver piece said lawful put treasury price blood mat 277 consulted together bought potter field bury stranger mat 278 therefore field ha called field blood thi day notice verse 5then hewent hanged matthew say juda died assume died result hanging act say act 118 thi man purchased field wage iniquity falling headlong burst open middle hi entrail gushed act 120 written book psalm let hi dwelling place desolate let one live let another take hi office may graphic explanation juda deathso line reasoning dispel ymy contradiction myth rethe two account juda death thismatthew doesnt necessarily explain juda died say juda hanged didnt specifically say juda died hanging incident however act seem show u hi graphic demise therefore contradiction matthew act juda death reply know matthew hang act probably record hi death although possible plausible fell hanging hit rock thereby bursting open longer assume case therefore contradiction matthew say juda died result hanging scholar believe probably quoted show highly regard scholar explanation looking text initially cant assume juda died however highly probable db way agree juda died hanging book different way dealing contradiction discussing one simply ignored entirely simply referred back matthew version correct version matt act biblical knowledge commentary suggested hypothesis juda hung rotted hi belly exploded doesnt explain hi headlong fall hi branch rope broke fell hi death hi gut gushed doesnt explain hanging man would fall headlong rather foot first reply outcome fall dependent upon many factorshow high person wa suspended fall obstruction tree branch may deviated fall steep incline rocky surface victim fell upon thu possibly rolling bouncing several rock etc superficial examination act passage matthew passage given lot info geographical specific tony quoted post gave u possible reconstruction would thi juda hanged tree edge precipice overlooked valley hinnom hung time limb tree snapped rope gave way juda fell ledge mangling hi body proces fall could death either would fit thi explanation thi possibility entirely natural terrain valley hinnom examined bottom valley see rocky terrace 25 40 foot height almost perpendicular still tree around ledge rocky pavement bottom therefore easy conclude juda struck one jagged rock thi way tearing hi body open db truthfully see comforting matthew confusing source potter field prophesy hand author correct matthew make confusion course biblical inerrantist claim every word bible guaranteed true god thereby add one contradiction death juda ie prophesy potter field came reply please done thi study hi death remind discus thi db ymy second question mr decenso ask could sure money juda purchased land wa indeed betrayal rather source would point act specifically mention reward iniquity act 118 also specifically mention act iniquity talking ie act 116 concerning juda wa guide arrested jesu would point bible describe act iniquity immediately discus reward iniquity would rather inane suggest wa action iniquity one discussed reply dave getting somewhere arent act 115 day peter stood midst disciple altogether number name wa hundred twenty said act 116 man brother thi scripture fulfilled holy spirit spoke mouth david concerning juda became guide arrested jesu act 117 wa numbered u obtained part thi ministry act 118 thi man purchased field wage iniquity falling headlong burst open middle hi entrail gushed act 119 became known dwelling jerusalem field called language akel dama field blood act 120 written book psalm let hi dwelling place desolate let one live let another take hi office notice verse 16 word iniquity used rather state juda became guide arrested jesu writer stop therev 17 wa numbered u obtained part thi ministry part juda play ministry joh 126 thi said cared poor wa thief money box used take wa put joh 1329 thought juda money box jesu said buy thing need feast give something poor know part juda played wa treasurer per se right peter stated juda played part thi ministry treasurer according john luke add parenthetical explanation wage iniquity money put ministry wa stolen juda purchase field believe thi better exegetical explanation wage iniquity think dave db since given clear answer even reference perhap could unequivocally state type inerrantist instead asking type think mr joslin reply gladly admit complete inerrantist although big problem limited inerrancy view frank one wished contend could answer one time thousand job 93
