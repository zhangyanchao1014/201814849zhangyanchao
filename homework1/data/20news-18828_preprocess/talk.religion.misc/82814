davebpogowvtekcom dave butler subject new biblical contradiction still answered juda mr decenso spite requiring scholarly opinion hanging juda reject scholarly opinion scholar rephrase scholar opinion subject know matthew hang act probably record hi death although possible plausible fell hanging hit rock thereby bursting open longer assume case therefore contradiction matthew say juda died result hanging scholar believe iprobably quoted show highly regard scholar explanation looking text initially cant assume juda died however highly probable also nothing greek suggest succes failure simply mean hang oneself actually research greek word apacgw find denote succes scholar indeed excellent reason assume suicide wa successful pointed recently checked several lexicon greek english lexicon new testament louw nida robinson greek english lexicon new testament greek english lexicon new testament grimm word study concordance tynsdale greek english lexicon new testament early christian writing bauerarndtgingrich new analytical greek lexicon perschbacher couple simply stated hanged oneself couple explicit stated apacgw mean specifically kill hanging couple also noted meaning one root word apacgw strangle throttle choke pretty much invalidate guy suggested david joslin juda wa hung upside one best reference though robinson greek english lexicon new testament stated translation gave root word literal translation related greek word use root also presented specific example word greek literature give context word apagchw ha two root word gchw strangle root root word apo mean literally away thi root word included word denote transition mean transition place eg greek word apagello mean send message apo also denote change state specifically change life death robinson specifically make comparison word apokteiuo mean kill literal meaning word apacgw mean throttle strangle put way implicitly denote change life state ie away life death word apacgw mean hang specifically denote death well thu robinson quite specific state mean hang oneself end one life hanging note use apacgw homer odessy 19230 denote context present example apacgw used explicitly mean suicide hanging since perfectly good word strangling without added denotation death insist bible wa written god every word precicely correct stuck complete meaning apacgw ie since word apacgw wa used death denoted result way note mr decenso also present example apacgw septuagint greek translation ot used time jesu used 2 samuel 1723 ahithophel saw hi advice wa followed saddled donkey arose went home hi house hi city put hi household order hanged died wa buried hi father tomb notice stated ahithophel hanged gr sept apagcho explicitly add died doubt result matthew explicitly told juda died note mr decenso say septuagint wa translation hebrew greek shown original meaning hebrew ie hebrew say died thu whether wa simply echoed greek also pointed regardles added died correct translation would still apacgw man indeed die strangulation redundant correct evidence septuagint wa repeatedly rewritten reedited included version contradicted editing wa even necessarily executed greek thu sure use septuagint stand paragon ancient greek really need prove ymy point mr decenso example ancient greek someone committing apacgw surviving otherwise would see simply making worthles assertion without corresponding evidence would note mr decenso everytime go way research one ymy apparently contrived exegisi pretty much find false thu think going add text something source clearly say better explicit greek historical source justify way mr rose statement tree around potter field still tree around ledge rocky pavement bottom unles mr rose show tree two thousand year old 2000 year old stump ha 2 thousand year old description area mention tree inappropriate assert present placement tree prove location tree two thousand year ago thing change ymy argument ie money juda used 30 silver ymy second question mr decenso ask could sure money juda purchased land wa indeed betrayal rather source would point act specifically mention reward iniquity act 118 also specifically mention act iniquity talking ie act 116 concerning juda wa guide arrested jesu would point bible describe act iniquity immediately discus reward iniquity would rather inane suggest wa action iniquity one discussed notice verse 16 word iniquity used rather state juda became guide arrested jesu writer stop therev 17 wa numbered u obtained part thi ministry part juda play ministry true peter author act specifically call juda betrayal iniquity matter neither john specifically call juda action iniquity either john 1329 say juda took money box rather said thought juda money box jesu wa telling buy need feast give something poor receiving morsel immediately went wa night note said juda left say took money box thu see ymy explanation still seem would choose unproven iniquity mentioned another author different book written different time iniquity explicitly mentioned author act find thi forced contrived course thi particular argument become moot since seen evidence apacgw mean suicide see since juda hanging wa successful could spent money mentioned john 1329 matthew mark explicitly say betrayal wa high holy day ie passover thu could spent money killing next day thu money bought field blood would 30 piece silver course got 30 piece silver night well thu couldnt spent either oh dear believe house card comming maybe thi point discus whether jesu wa crucified friday saturday part argument juda way prophesy potter field came ie mention matthew say please done thi study hi death remind discus thi reminding discus part verse discussing wish would quit procrastinating sidestepping issue later dave butler wise man proportion hi belief evidence david hume philosopher inquiry concerning human understanding p would note stating bible possibly inerrant stating inerrant since ymy admission presenting merely possible reconciliation course dont rate highly best say bible possibly inerrant inerrant
