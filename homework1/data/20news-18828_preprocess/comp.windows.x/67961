topic seem use x11r5 faster r4 please see x faq complete detail window manager lot window manager lot different feature ability choice use necessity balancing act performance useful feature thi point respondent agreed upon twm best candidate speedy window manager couple generic trick try soup ymy window manger turning unnecessary thing like zooming opaque move also lay ymy window tiled manner reduce amount cpu power spent raising lowering overlapping window joe english joetrysteroartcom ive found good font tiling 7x13 aka miscfixedmediumrnormal13100100100c70iso88591 biggest font know use sun 1152x900 screen still get two 80 column terminal window sidebyside display overlap font suggestion accepted x server server make sure ymy server proper match ymy hardware monochrome monitor use monochrome x11 server monochrome sun havent noticed much difference xsun colmy server xsunmono however wa pointed xsunmono 800k smaller therefore contribute le paging thank jonny farringdon jfarringdonpsycholuclacuk michael salmon michaelsalmoneosericssonse ymy server wa compiled also make difference jeff law lawschirfcsutahedu advise u sun system x compiled gcc version 2 unbundled sun compiler expect get large speedup server using bundled suno compiler assume similar result would occur used one highquality commercial compiler market locking server ram ha anyone tried hacking x server locked ram get paged eg vium call plock thi help performance ive one inquiry thi topic pointer plock function call hard evidence someone tried position give try thank eric c claey eccepermattcom danny backx dbsunbimbe juan martin juandocnmuse starting ymy server joe english joetrysteroartcom start lot client ymy xsession whatever sleep second two launching one changed xclient script thi logging actually took le time heavily loaded system without much core though thi sound crazy confirmed work warner losh impsolbournecom provided good explanation thi work summarized start x server take huge amount time start accepting connection lot initialization done server start thi proces touch large number page proces running time would fight server use cpu importantly memory put sleep give server chance get sorted client start similarly also lot initialization whenever x client program start toolkit registering widget resource fetched program initializing state databasis forth thi activity typically memory intensive thi initialization done proces ha reached steady state memory usage typically settle using page using sleep stagger launching ymy client ymy xinitrc avoid fighting ymy workstation limited resource thi definitely ymy mileage may vary situation many variable considered available ram local swap space load average number user ymy system client starting etc currently xinitrc situation like sleep 1 exec xclock sleep 1 exec xbiff sleep 1 exec xterm sleep 1 exec xterm ive experimented sleep 1 exec xclock sleep 2 exec xbiff sleep 3 exec xterm sleep 4 exec xterm ive even tried sleep 2 exec startxclientsscript startxclientsscript sleep 1 exec xclock sleep 1 exec xbiff sleep 1 exec xterm sleep 1 exec xterm idea thi last one wa make sure xinit completely finished processing xinitrc settled steady state sleep expired client launched yielded fairly comparable result stuck current setup simplicity probably experiment bit find setup suit font loading font take time ram minimize number font ymy application use youll get speed increase loadup time one simple strategy choose small number font one small one large one roman whatever suit configure ymy client least ymy heavily used client use font client program start quicker font already loaded server thi also conserve server resource since fewer font loaded server farrell mckay fbmptcburpptcbuozau joe english joetrysteroartcom eg main xterm font 7x13 also twm set use 7x13 menu icon etc twm default font 8x13 since dont normally use 8x13 ive eliminated one font server oliver jone ojroadrunnerpictelcom keep font local workstation rather loading nf make extensive use r5 scalable font use font server resource file keep ymy xresource xdefault file small save ram save server startup time joe english joetrysteroartcom one suggestion ymy xdefault xresource file try putting minimum number resource want available ymy application example reversevideo true separate ymy resource individual clientspecific resource file example homelibappdefault ymy login file set environment variable xuserfilesearchpath setenv xuserfilesearchpath homelibappdefaultsn compwindowsx frequently asked question faq contain excellent explanation environment variable work ed xterm launch load resource appdefaultsxterm xdvus find appdefaultsxdvus forth note client follow xxxxx resourcefile naming pattern check ymy system appdefault directory often usrx11r5libx11appdefault find proper name name ymy personal resource file name thi documented xt specification pg 125 666 thank kevin samborn sambornmtkgccom michael urban urbancobrajplnasagov mike long mikeleecornelledu kevin willing mail hi setup file inquirer thi method organizing ymy personal resource ha following benefit easier maintain usable fewer resource stored x server resourcemanager property side benefit ymy server may start fractionally quicker since doesnt load ymy resource application proces resource never sort ymy resource find one affect also ha drawback application interested ha load additional file every time start thi doesnt seem make much performance difference might consider thi huge boon usability modifying application resource database need rerun application without xrdb xrdb default run ymy xdefault file cpp ymy resource split multiple resource file loaded individual client program watch thi c style comment xdefault file cpp stripped switched thi method distributed resource file spent several frustrating day trying figure client finding resource xt provide error message encountered c style comment resource file simply silently aborted processing resource file los preprocessing handy eg ifdef color enough cause person dismis thi method resource management may also run client break rule example neither emac 18583 xvt 10 find resource anywhere xdefault starting client machine share file machine ymy resource stored ymy client find resource loading ymy resource server guarantee ymy client alway find resource casey leedom caseygaussllnlgov possible compromise suggestion planning trying put resource heavily used client eg xterm xdefault file use separate resource file method client seldom use define ymy display properly client program often executed machine server situation rather setting ymy display environment variable hostname00 hostname name ymy workstation set ymy display variable unix00 00 thi acces optimized routine know server machine use shared memory method transferring request thank patrick j horgan pjh70rasamdahlcom see display name section x1 man page explanation properly set ymy display name dont think stock mit least datum general hp library smart enough use local communication even display isnt set specially rob sartin 88opensisartinuunetuunet jody goldberg jodyalgorithmicscom sent xlib patch change stock r5 use local communication even display properly set dont want get busines distributing trying juggle nonmit patch elected include hopefully mit apply thi minor 8 line patch themself meantime want try email jody ed client megabyte ram think carefully number program running think also kind program running example smaller clock program xclock unfortunately havent really noticed program advertise large onu u research spread word suggestion better alternative standard client eg xclock xterm xbiff welcome ed ive received contradictory advice person subject x client program advocate use program strictly xlib based since xt xaw toolkit rather large warn u application using may already loaded one shared library thi case using nonxt example client program may actually increase amount ram consumed upshot thi seem dont mix toolkit try use athena client xview client motif client etc use one youre dragging one toolkit library know ymy environment think carefully client program would work best together environment thank rob sartin 88opensisartinuunetuunet duncan sinclair sinclairdcsglaacuk sinclairukacgladc better clock x 1 xcuckoo suggested duncan sinclair sinclairdcsglaacuk available exportlcsmitedu xcuckoo display clock title bar another program save screen real estate 2 mclock suggested der mouse mouselightningmcrcimmcgilledu available larrymcrcimmcgilledu 13220611 xmclockshar non xtbased extensively configurable made look much like mit oclock mostly like xclock purely changing resource course ultimate clock one consume resource take screen real estate one hang ymy wall better terminal emulator x readme file distributed xterm abandon hope ye enter thi undoubtedly ugly program distribution ugly maybe site still used suspect xterm one used client many site lazines isnt better terminal emulator available see must use xterm try reducing number saveline reduce memory usage oliver jone ojroadrunnerpictelcom jonny farringdon jfarringdonpsycholuclacuk 1 xvt suggested richard hesketh rlh2ukcacuk available exportlcsmitedu contribxvt10tarz dont need esoteric feature xterm get hold xvt wa written save swap space xterm rather hog thi wa written partial clone xterm dont rename ymy resource xvt pretend xterm current version bind key xterm ive heard version xvt thi feature ive found yet update march 1993 recently email conversation brian warkentin brianwarkentineengsuncom regarding xvt question whether xvt really faster xterm instance xvt may initialize slightly faster compare scrolling speed try thi quickie benchmark bintime dd ifetctermcap bs40 see program scroll faster also xterm may slightly larger ram requirement dont hard number anyone else shared library shared text segment mean xterm paging requirement major experiment ripped tek stuff xterm made little difference since never use never get brought memory stand conflicting report validity xvt xterm summary caveat emptor ymy mileage may vary provide hard datum id like see specifically much ram occupy much swap need relative speed 2 mterm suggested der mouse mouselightningmcrcimmcgilledu available larrymcrcimmcgilledu 13220611 xmtermsrcmtermballowax also terminal emulator major lack scrollback person like anyway tuning ymy client suggestion tune ymy client program work faster scott barman scottasdcom come suggestion regarding motif text field widget noticed datum entry motif text field widget wa getting slight lag response keystroke particularly initial one field examining wa going xscope found seem resource xmnblinkrate nonzero focu text field widget even text widget ibeam cursor blink every time cursor appear disappear widget widget code making request server copyarea user stop thi setting resource xmnblinkrate 0 noticeable 40mhz sparc make little difference slower system thi specific suggestion probably applied general lot area consider ymy heavily used client minor embellishment turned thereby save server request miscellaneou suggestion pretty picture dont use large bitmap gif etc root window background complicated ymy root window bitmap slower server redrawing ymy screen reposition window redraw etc take ram cpu power work sun sparc im consciou performance issue cant comprehend see person 4mb sun 360 running xphoon root window ill let someone else figure much ram would occupied full screen root image colmy workstation youre anything like need screen real estate get client rarely see root window anyway thank qiang alex zhao azhaocsarizonaedu reminding thi one ed quicker mouse using xset adjust fast ymy pointer move screen move ymy mouse use xset 3 10 xinitrc file let send pointer acros screen flick wrist see xset man page idea information hint

create destroy widget fly try reuse thi avoid many problem buggy toolkit use line width 0 gc server thi make huge difference compres collapse multiple expose event thi make difference fast application completely unusable one francoi stae franskiwiuiaacbe small remark heard using better malloc function would greatly increase performance xt based application since use malloc heavily suggested trying gnuy malloc didnt find time yet test small program malloc free difference indeed noticeable somewhat 5 time faster confirmation thi anyone ed andre beck andrebeckirsinftudresdende unnecessary noexpose event person use xcopyareaxcopyplane fastest blit routine forget reset graphicsexposure gc used blit thi cause noexpose event every blit case put load onto connection force client run eventloop thousand xchangegc request thi gfx context switching also seen handcoded xapp one gc created heavily changed xt use definitely better mechanism caching sharing lot gc needed parameter thi remove load subsequent xchangegc request connection moving toward client startup phase say contributor proposed idea seem right wall first david b lewi day dblosforg night davidcraftuunetuunet thi swap display someone else run ymy program machine display locally user run ymy machine onto display goal reduce context switch operation client server im situation easily try thi received following confirmation michael salmon michaelsalmoneosericssonse regularly run program machine notice big difference try run machine reduce net usage usually nice reduce impact intrusion thi help lot poor little ss1 16 mb
