ashokbiochemistrycwruedu ashok aiyar subject setting slip client window long posting monthly howtosetup slip client pc post month lot work imminent graduation come way posting one march earlier thi month apologize thi file include information writing script university minnesotum phone also batch file hack let use packet driver phone addition modification correction reached ashokbiochemistrycwruedu best wish ashok begin sliptxt based experience setting slip window comment setting slip thi environment thank trumpet betum tester cwru slip betum tester comment configuring ymy modem turn dtr atd0w disable dtr communication program use dial slip server qmodem drop dtr exit program therefore hang line use program like kermit conex establish slip connection thi need done program necessarily hangup line exit note use univ minn phone dial establish slip connection need turn dtr b dial establish slip connection first thi done automatically use program like phone university minnesotum dial establish slip connection load slip packet driver phone scripting language simple phone script easily written configure phone work slip server addition packet driver phone work umslip currently easy write batch file hack let phone work packet driver section phone document script batch file example configuring slip driver five slip packet driver commonly available cslipperexe peter tattam compressed slip driver slipperexe peter tattam slip driver slip8250com crynwr driver like phil burn modified driver etherslcom crynwr driver ethernet simulation slip umslipcom univ minnesotum driver based slip8250 fmy vastly prefer cslipperexe slip8250com etherslcom following reason much faster even though modem ha 16450 uart b using etherslipslip8250umslip several noticed pc clock get messed performing long ftp transfer c support pktmux used ethernet simulation mode used ethernet simulation mode cslipper seem work every tcpip application tested instruction cslipperexe use phone load slipper ymy autoexecbat file according instruction instance v32bi modem com1 slipper com1 vec62 baud57600 b use tcpip application win 31 box use doubleended packet driver shim winpktcom thi create virtual packet driver 0x60 application native mode application window 31 box window application use thi virtual driver 0x60 winpktcom 0x60 0x62 c use qvtnet load pktintcom next qvtnet configured qvtnetini use interrupt 0x60 pktintcom instruction slip8250com try getting version 10 slip driver philip burn northwestern university ha modified slip8250com driver better hardware handshaking thi driver distributed along nupop b load driver establishing slip connection modem v32bi modem com1 would load driver slip8250 w 0x62 h 4 slip 0x03f8 57600 c discussed use tcpip application window 3x box probably want use winpktcom winpktcom 0x60 0x62 use winqvtnet load pktintcom pktintcom instruction etherslcom choose use etherslcom instead slip8250com instruction exactly one crucial difference delete line devicevcd 386enh section systemini thi interfere running regular window comm application crosstalk get lot dropped character etc application thi therefore recommended etherslip would loaded ethersl w 0x62 h 4 0x03f8 57600 configuring window 31 make following modification systemini file 386enh section list ymy com port address interrupt com1base03f8

used ethernet simulation mode example thi configuration shown latest release pktmux 12c important use thi version want use virtual packet driver application like trumpet window released shortly autoexecbat lh cslipper com1 vec65 baud57600 ether packet driver lh pktmux 5 65 5 pktmux loaded 5 virtual packet driver lh pktdrv 7f 65 first virtual packet driver used qvtnet lh pktintcom qvtnet pktintcom pktdrv 63 65 pktdrv use native wintrumpet additional virtual packet driver loaded directly within window 31 box example pif file load popmail directed file popmailbat thi popmailbat read

experience pktmux work fine even virtual packet driver two independent virtual session loaded software interrupt example within two different box one popmail gopher virtual packet driver pktdrv loaded 0x60 instance much pktmux degrade performance cslipper v32bisv42bi modem 38633 running window 31 reasonably fast video card atus graphic ultra condition three virtual packet driver loaded used follow driver 0x7f qvtnet ftp client session b driver 0x60 one window cutcp tn3270 session c driver 0x60 another window trumpet get ftp transfer rate 08 10 kbsec transferring compressed file thi rate comparable get slip8250 loaded packet driver single tcpip session active cslipper used packet driver single session active get transfer rate 13 14 kbsec file 40 degradation performance slipper benefit able use pktmux outweigh performance hit cslipper ethernet simulation mode ethernet simulation mode cslipper ver 13 work application tested one two application required ethernet simulation balked cslipper 12 even rare problem resolved ver 13 slipper used ethernet simulation mode used pktmux get error message qvtnet console window read ipincorrect packet type ipbad version number thi seem prevent qvtnet functioning although comment los performance ymy tcpip application work cslipper ethernet simulation mode rare event find package work cslipper ethernet simulation mode first contact author peter tattam peterpsychnetpsycholutaseduau let know chance fix meanwhile try following know kosher worked problem cslipper ver 12 cslipper loaded 0x62 described pktmux section load etherslcom 0x60 run application terminate etherslcom thi also work within window 31 virtual box however packet driver like ethersl used one virtual box time example batch file run grateful med medical reference retrieval program developed national library medicine ethersl w 0x60 h 4 0x03f8 57600 load etherslip cd gm6 search cd termin 0x60 terminate etherslip exit close box return window use thi method cautiou one thing dont active pktmux session open time closing ethersl window run ymy pktmux session problem btw example grateful med work problem cslipper ver 13 phone script file documentation
