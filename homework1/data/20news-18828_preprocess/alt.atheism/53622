fanatism caused theism theism lead fanatism point theism increase chance becoming fanatic one could course argue would fanatic tend toward theism example loook time history theism wa dominant ideology invalidate conclusion basic mechanism behind imo influence stalin matter ayn rand invalidate ymy assumption theism factor considered bogu said theism factor fanatism point theism factor ymy claim back consider ymy argument useful following belief strongly correlated fanaticism therefore belief factor fanaticism true utterly useles note thi belief belief god tiring say least backed read first statement read conspicuou absence evidence point latter fallacy wrong analogy saying someone believe something hardly information person saying someone theist hold much information correlation theist fanatism higher belief fanatism special feature theistic belief truth blatant assertion evidence gullibility blind obedience authority lack scepticism reliable indicator really dangerou person source fanaticism often none thing cynical manipulator gullible know precisely claim support please note especially field theism leader believe say believe youre incredibly naive frank odwyer living dream world wonder base discussion left statement matter fact think ignorant human nature even one start something one believe one get easily fooled actually believing one say give benefit doubt prove ymy statement onu proof sunshine make think theist leader believe say especially say one thing another say one thing closely followed opposite practice restricted theism anyone see almost epidemic thi country instance harder camel pa thru eye needle catholic church wealthy landowner church square inch country brand theism precisely theist tend fanaticism grant tar theist thi brush bigotry reasoned argument read like warmup censorship restriction religiou freedom ever read animal farm straw man usually discussion one ha repeat read written every theism lead fanatism fanatism caused theism point correlation come innate feature theism come feature theism ha common fanaticism ymy last statement simply isnt implied say youre trying sneak innate feature theism word youre groping bogu theism fanatic however rest already gife backup statement correlation fanatism theism specialty theistic belief allows switch fanatism easily take nifty improvement theology truth blatant assertion gullibility way one shit sherlock talk gullibility instead theism since seem whole lot relevant case opposed case trying make theism attraction gullible person causing correlation whole discussion started way statement theism meaningfully correlated fanatism challenged indeed recall asked evidence correlation speak say going forbid religion another ymy straw man interesting nothing better offer said read like warm irrational bogu tirade ha use creating nice themu split mind excitable person found either side church wall blah blah blah quite well aware giving everyone right protect better fanatic way round course person alway fanatic never oneself ymy wish slur theist seem pretty fanatical quite nice see actually implying connection argument rise fanatism far another ymy assertion 2 define irrational belief eg rational believe reason alway useful irrational belief belief based upon reason latter ha discussed long time charley wingate one point belief violate reason often another proces lend rational analysi contain reliable information well glaring paradox argument reason useful based reason would circular argument based reason would irrational bogu self reference circular since evaluation usefulnes possible within rational system allowed ok oval still begging question however though certainly allowed rational claiming rational another ymy assertion proof evidence claim hey learned good risk repeating hearing didnt hear refutation back deal cant use reason demonstrate reason useful someone think reason crap wont buy see unusually weak even latter imply proof depend opinion somehow accept triangle wont accept pythagora wow incredible insight dont prove wrong opinion possible show system leave useful information respectively claim unreliable even absurd statement information totally circular totally useles wish believe make believe thing judge appeal information make feel good believe may good contain zillion possible pitfall belief despite contrary evidence bogu proof attempt truth blatant assertion ive seen many bogu proof nonexistence god existence rational system way mean every datum ha come logical analysi point evaluation datum contradict logic easily follow system allows evaluate rational ye possible evaluate rational system rational fallacy system since validity axiom agreed upon ha little impact possibility demon ala descarte thi doesnt parse sorry far matter consistency use ratiional argument show system consistent isnt evaluation thi prediction need rationality contradict however ymy argument silly proving mathematical statement need mathematics mathematics therfore circular anybody else think godel wa silly stream consciousnes typing supposed mean first part second statement contain information dont say belief belief strong theism andor strong atheism ymy statement general true second part ymy sentence patently false counterexample axiomatic datum lend rational analysi assumed contain reliable information regardles proces used obtain ive speaking religiou system contradictory definition god axiomatic datum lend rational analysi say often refuted fallacy look discussion axiom choice one evaluate axiom larger system usually derived exist derived want way one test consistency set axiom trying say point person alway wind saying thi datum reliable particular reason example dreaming nope evidence trick choice axiomatic basi system difficult possibility interwoven one therefore choose least assumption assumption necessary get information system anyway id like see thi alleged evidence one need define axiom order define evaluation method usefulnes foundation laid one feel one feel see irrational belief fanatic never compared evidence theist claim strength demand make whole thing irrational antirational cant agree thi specific theism say theism necessarily antirational require proof suspect using traditonal definition god personal supernatural entity objective effect thi world usually connected moral andor way world work imo belief god necessarily irrational mean person hold principle opposed exercise intelligence atheist also scientist example dont use theism science wouldnt science please note subjective datum lend themself scientific treatment well prohibit formulating objective statement ergo nothing objective fair enough affinity fanatism easily seen ha true believe nothing work hypothesi however belief say work hypothesi dont understand thi formalise ymy argument person believe system b becuase sound nice make b true best work hypothesi however content b true work hypothesi testing evaluating evidence therefore dismissed b already believed say wrong waste time possible depending content b amalekitesidolatersprotestant killed thi interesting effect peculiar definition interesting sure show belief god entail content speak arent catholic neighbour killing protestant example maybe dont believe maybe conjunction b assert b jailkill dissenter important belief god entirely irrelevant certainly seem axe grind example ymy neighbour fallacy ymy neighbour dont say little time exactly happened nope fallacy doesnt go correlation wish see tell irrelevant statement amalekite idolater holy book please note one could edit relevant anymore god dont err say message excuse holy book come theist saying genocide ordered god ok god easiest way excuse anything therefore highly attracting fanatic mention effect interpretation fanatic rest believer happen god neither easiest way excuse anything way frank odwyer im hatching odwyersseie hen evelyn conlon
