scott compton write jim originally wrote god create disease responsible malady newborn god create wa life according protein code mutable evolve without delving deep discussion creationism v evolutionism god created original genetic code perfect without flaw evidence thi code wa perfect ha degraded ever since evidence favmy thi statement shouldnt perhap biggest imperfection code full noncoding region intron called intervene coding region exon impressive amount evidence suggest intron ancient origin likely early exon represented early protein domain number intron decreasing increasing appear intron los occur specie common ancestry usually quite similar exonintron structure gene hand possibility intron inserted later present several logical difficulty intron removed splicing mechanism thi would present unused intron inserted moreover intron insertion would required precise targeting random insertion would tolerated since sequence intron removal selfsplicing mrna conserved beside transposition sequence usually leaf trace long terminal repeat target site duplication found near intron sequence seriously recommend reading textbook molecular biology genetic posting theological argument like thi try watson molecular biology gene darnell lodish baltimore molecular biology cell starter remember question wa posed theological context god cause disease newborn answer likewise theological perspective le valid purely scientific perspective different scientific perspective supported evidence wherea theological perspective often fail fulfil thi criterion think misread meaning said god made genetic code perfect doesnt mean perfect ha certainly evolved since worse would please cite reference support ymy assertion ymy assertion le valid scientific perspective unles support evidence fact ha claimed parasite disease perhap important weve thought instance sex might evolved defence parasite thi view supported computer simulation evolution eg tierra perhap thought wa higher energy ray like xray gamma ray cosmic ray caused damage fact thermal energy damage although usually mild easily fixed enzymatic action actually neither u know atmosphere wa like time god created life according recollection biologist claim life began 4 billion year ago would half billion year earth wa created would still primitive support life seem remember figure like 25 3 billion year ago origination life earth anyone better estimate id replace created formed since need invoke creator earth formed without one recent estimate age earth range 46 48 billion year earliest sign life true fossil organic stromatolitelike layer date back 35 billion year thi would leave billion year first cell evolve im sorry cant give reference thi based course evolutionary biochemistry attended dominion wa great feat satan genetically engineer disease bacterialviral genetic although force natural selection tend improve survivability specie degeneration genetic code tend offset thi want thi true evidence thi supposed degeneration understand scott reaction excuse thi farfetched know must jesting know pathogen know point mutation know everything come spontaneously response ymy last statement neither may well believe accept fact know hope dont forget thi evidence suggest everything come spontaneously evidence thi conclusion science one believe anything healthy sign doubt disbelieve right path walk take look evidence present one conclusion prior thi theology use thi method therefore seriously doubt could ever come right conclusion human dna complex tend accumulate error adversely affecting wellbeing ability fight disease simpler dna bacterium viruse tend become efficient causing infection disease bad combination hence newborn suffer genetic viral bacterial diseasesdisorder supposing purpose valid move bacterium viruse exist cause disease another manifest general principle evolution replication save replicator degradiation efficient method dna survive replicate le efficient method didnt make present last time please present evidence ymy claim human dna degrading evolutionary process person claimed opposite true suppressed selection thu bound degrade havent seen much evidence either claim ask thi relevant discussion answering john question genetic disease many bacterial viral disease require baby develop antibody god fault original question say course nothing evil god fault ymy explanation work fail miserably may right fact dont know satan responsible neither suppose powerful evil like satan exist would inconceivable might responsible many ill affect mankind dont think could done much better job pun intended problem seem satan necessary explain disease inevitable product evolution say seem like another bad inference actually youve done oversimplify said point ymy summary word take new context never said person meant presumably god punished getting disease say free moral choice attendent consequence mankind choose reject god person done since beginning expect god protect adverse event entropic universe expecting thi god exist expect leave u alone would also like hear believe ymy choice indeed free thi interesting philosophical question answer clearcut seem consequence would expect rejecting allah oh admit perfect yet im working good library bookstore good starting point thi price tea china question provided answer biology genetic fine subject important scientific endeavor explain god created set life process dont explain behind creation life subsequent evolution behind ymy proposition wa something supported evidence thi recommend book need invoke behind prime mover evidence thi whole universe come existence without intervention recent cosmological theory hawking et al suggest person still insist thi thank scotty ymy fine sagely advice highly motivated learn nittygritty detail biology genetic although im sure id find fascinating subject realize detail change big picture god created life beginning ability change adapt environment im sorry evidence ymy big picture need create anything capable adaptation come existence without supreme try reading pw atkin creation revisited
