physic expert authority said example simon newcomb declared 1901 demonstration possible combination known substance known form machinery known form force united practical machine man shall fly long distance air seem writer complete possible demonstration physical fact fortunately smart person wright brother accept pronouncement final word take airplane granted except crash today orthodox physicist scientist saying similar thing several kind free energy technology using negative term pseudoscience perpetual motion citing socalled law assert energy created destroyed 1st law thermodynamic alway decrease useful energy 2nd law thermodynamic physicist know certain thing arrogantly declare thing done principle impotence common orthodox modern science help cover inconsistency contradiction orthodox modern theory free energy invention device tap seemingly unlimited supply energy universe burning kind fuel making perfect solution worldwide energy crisi associated pollution degradation depletion environment free energy device probably create energy rather tap existing natural energy source variou form induction unlike solar wind device need little energy storage capacity tap much energy needed needed solar energy ha disadvantage sun often blocked cloud tree building earth reduced haze smog thick atmosphere low altitude high latitude likewise wind speed widely variable often nonexistent neither solar wind power suitable directly power car airplane properly designed free energy device limitation example least three u patent 3811058 3879622 4151431 far awarded motor

one energy source mentioned despite fact fit definition free energy bulgarianborn american physicist named joseph maglich ha invented partially developed atomic fusion reactor call migma use nonradioactive deuterium fuel available nearly unlimited quantity sea water produce radioactive waste converted directly electricity without energywasting steam turbine constructed small enough power

news lately originally conducted university utah researcher b stanley pon martin fleischmann u navy researcher china lake naval weapon center californium direction chemist melvin mile finally took trouble collect bubble coming apparatu analyzed massspectrometry technique found helium 4 prove atomic fusion indeed take place enough explain exces heat generated good indication two socalled law thermodynamic absolute example late physicist dewey b larson developed comprehensive general unified theory physical universe call reciprocal system describe detail several book nothing motion 1979 universe motion 1984 physical universe ha two distinct half material half antimatter half continuou cycle matter energy passing without heat death predicted thermodynamic law hi theory explain universe much better modern orthodox theory including phenomenon orthodox physicist astronomer still scratching head selfconsistent every way free energy device might tapping energy flow seemingly converting lowquality energy highquality energy also certain religiou organization sant mat eckankar teach member physical universe lowest least dozen major level existence like parallel universe analogou tv channel described book like path master dr julian johnson 1939 eckankar key secret world srus paul twitchell 1969 example next level physical universe commonly called astral plane longtime

many successful laboratorycontrolled experiment psychokinesi throughout world described book psychic discovery behind iron curtain term economic market ha failed inventor enough money resource fully develop massproduce free energy equipment conventional energy producer desire veted interet government needed intervene government intervene total supply energy resource earth continue decline soon run price energy increase pollution harmful effect including greenhouse effect acid rain smog radioactive contamination oil spill rape land strip mining etc continue increase government subsidize research development free energy inventor university subsidize private production producer make subsidize consumption lowincome consumer free energy hardware longrange effect government intervention would widespread profound quantity energy demanded conventional energy producer coal mining companie oil companie country electric utilitie etc would drop near zero forcing employee seek work elsewhere energy resource coal uranium oil ga would left ground price conventional energy supply would also drop near zero price free energy equipment would start high drop supply increase happened vcr personal computer etc cost producing product require large quantity energy produce would decrease along price consumer consumer would able realize opportunity cost paying electric utility bill buying home heating fuel tourism would benefit increase traveler would spend money gasoline car government tax revenue gasoline fuel would obtained way energy could longer used motive excuse making war many conventional energy producer would go busines society whole earth environment ecosystem would benefit greatly person government serve rather big corporation bank information answer ymy
