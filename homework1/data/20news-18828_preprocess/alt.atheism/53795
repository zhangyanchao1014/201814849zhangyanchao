construction evidence existence either benefactor bug atm premise 2 observation alteriu possible except bank couldnt possibly afford forgot include thi premise actually premise 2 cardinality set possible observation alteriu one thi clearly contradictory first state properly trouble basi premise 2 say evidence either benefactor bug first premise lead conclusion appearance buck happen evidence existence either benefactor bug voila screaming contradiction highlight sc strawman argument evidence oneofbenefactorbug observation distinguish benefactor bug possible evidence bug neither evidence benefactor true say thi hypothetical universe appear exactly benefactorbug two statement would false thi still contradictory reduce 1 alterian dosh arriving account due benefactor bug 2 thi evidence benefactor neither evidence bug meaning doesnt lend weight one 3 therefore evidence exist benefactor evidence exist bug 3 rely shift meaning 2 say paraphrased 2 thi evidence benefactor example mean evidence benefactor bug ye mean 3 however youve shifted meaning evidence benefactor mean absolute evidence benefactor rather relative evidence benefactor wrt bug really meant evidence would tend one think thi communication problem trying say clumsy way buy ymy theory far relate theism making prediction prayer ymy rapture example dont buy ymy use occam razor case a0 example one couldnt dismis benefactor bug ground simplicity one necessary explain dosh brought onebyone dismissal proces show would wrong youre saying thi post seem agree talking crosspurpose 3 still contradiction 1 sum may

observation weve already seen dosh change estimate wa trying say clumsy way would wrong assign 0 probability either precisely use razor case god god one clas hypothesi many belonging set hypothesis oneofwhich necessary explain something otherwise would satisfactorily explained thrown retained ground nonrational preference science statistic alternatively one could chuck retain lot ground answer cant known notional probability estimate effectively useles equal agnosticismweak atheism set filled universe caused x x god pink unicorn nothing etc observation tend one conclusion exactly point wa making think dont throw contrary ymy assertion person simon think excellent science sole point wa arent observation directly contradict hypothesi hi ie x px hi 0 cause phi go zero finite number observation thi case get throw hypothesis exactly point though may unclear said diametric opposite gues source confusion wa merely trying illustrate incorrectnes im trying say correct say absence evidence sometime evidence absence thi hold true perhap version theism isnt true hold discarded using razor contrary hold exactly discarded using razor see post branch thi thread seem guilty contradiction accuse razor hold god hold like hypothesis mean youre assigning px hi 0 though weve already established correct sumpxhi1 simply put anyone claim viable proof existence nonexistence god whether inductive best mistaken worst barking mad luckily make claim specifically said much numerou occasion wouldnt constructing strawman would frank although doesnt course rule barking mad case could barking mad spare time apology cleese et al think mi point say something evidence hypothesi doesnt imply observation said something necessarily falsify hypothesi reducing estimate ph datum zero reduce thi quantity still evidence h got im talking case a0 youre clearly correct a0 im constructing strawman though certainly possible ive misunderstood youre saying however standard system say a0 god highly unlikely a0 god dismissed using razor system purporting inductive proof god either dont exist unnecessary explain phenomenon experience system thi including purport prove god exist alway contain fallacy upon close examination youre saying please put straight frank odwyer im hatching odwyersseie hen evelyn conlon
