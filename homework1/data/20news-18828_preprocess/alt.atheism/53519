israel conflict one another word treasury replaced king jame scholar potter precisely thi made matthew quote fit better thi blatant error correct translation hebrew indeed treasury also make perfect sense zechariah context wherea potter field totally unrelated whether mistranslation wa intentional seem beyond speculation however given matthew track record one find hard resist notion intentional dishonesty course matthew would ample reason altering text thirty piece silver match juda situation christian seem reader willing disregard contextual incongruity matthew might another prophecy tos

version gospel tale jesu get executed along two thieve mk 1527 crucified two robber one hi right one hi left scripture wa fulfilled say wa reckoned transgressor mark trying link jesu passage isaiah 53 servant nation israel passage messiah one read whole chapter isaiah 53 surrounding chapter one see servant nation verse also thi servant ha gone past prediction come event servant thought criminal thi also happen fit description jesu passage really messiah still clear executing jesu two thieve would fulfill prophecy isaiah jesu would fittingly fulfill hi whole ministry wa considered blasphemer troublemaker throughout hi career locking onto single event rather poor way steal prophecy least thi case see mark could made better analogy general comparison mark go tell u crucified jesu also reviled 1532 thi expected couple robber course hi later recount st luke decide change thing luke tell u lk 233943 one criminal wa hanged railed arent messiah save u thi certainly fit mark recount tell
