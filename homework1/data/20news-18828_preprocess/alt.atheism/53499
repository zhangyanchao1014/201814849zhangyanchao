solving problem method ha worked working method thi true extent however think brain work like computer fact substantial evidence skarda 1985 skarda freeman 1987 brain work le chaotically generating enough randomnes mental state evolve brain work much like genetic algorithm generator suppose trick still ha form discovered thi mean idea ever already preprogrammed brain thi somewhat unlikely given brain ultimately encoded 46 chromosome worth genetic material much isnt used indeed thi extremely unlikely given vast impact nurture mind brain suggest however trying understand consciousnes

advice thi discussion lead anywhere background different please bring qm thi discussion physicist happy claim consciousnes play special role physic would say doesnt problem algorithm instability many

wavefunction state vector reduction r mysteriou usually said occur measurement take place although nobody seem know precisely occur occur effect r abruptly change wavefunction mind required thi thi mean human mind came scene wavefunction never collapsed remained superposition aeon powerful thi ha discussed think thi topic irrelevant since agree mind necessary neither physicist anyway im speculating mind would part x seem link consciousnes r never see linear superposition anything although alternative explaination thi ive idea brain supposed acces part x since thi speculation wont matter much main point might place mind physic agree sense apparently mean physic need sharp mind solve many real problem ill go back nice padded cell ok ok dont forget take reference wrote previou
