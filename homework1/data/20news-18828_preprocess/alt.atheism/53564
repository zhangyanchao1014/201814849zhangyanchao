k pb k px px px b px b equally consistent datum observing x doesnt give pointer b operative particular case h b hg however know prior probability ordered ph phg although dont know actual value thi allows u deploy razor throw hg also real world isnt clear cut dry seem cant alway determine whether equality px h px hg true certainly true particular point wa whether divine component actually underly prevalence religion addition memetic transmission component even religiou implicitly acknowledge operative talk spreading word seem ive said observed variance religiou belief well accounted memetic transmission model rather le well one propose divine component addition since would expect latter conspire wide variance even mutual exclusion among belief thu personal feeling px hg isnt even equal px h thi case smaller h memetic transmission g divine component x variance among belief happily acknowledge thi subjective impression btw beef ymy baysian argument wa mathematical one checked ymy work didnt find error seem careful probably isnt math mistake think mistake philosophical make sure understand please rephrase nontechnical term think thi reasonable request alway try look way explaining physic nonphysicist im baysian statistician type statistician thi would helpful im statistician either idea theism atheism compatible read observation date however theism type concerned also suggest instance prayer may answered person may miraculously healed principle amenable statistical verification god may generally intervene measurable way thi mean region space possible observation loosely termed appearance god nonzero probability theistic hypothesi zero atheistic since much probability available hypothesi scatter around observation space probability theism expend making appearance god possible must come somewhere else ie possible observation else equal thi mean observation isnt appearance god must slightly higher probability atheism theism bayesian stuff imply observation must cause running estimate probability atheistic hypothesi increase corresponding decrease running estimate probability theistic hypothesi sorry still bit jargonesque rather difficult put way since depend intimately property conditional probability density particularly total area alway unity analogy may may helpful say hypothesi coin fair b coin unfair twoheaded ive used b avoid confusion hhead ttail ph 05 total 1 pt 05 ph b 1 total 1 pt b 0 observation string head tail thi compatible fair coin twoheaded coin b however probability expended making possible appearance tail even though dont actually appear must come somewhere else since total must unity come thi case probability appearance head say running estimate time n1 en1a en1b observation xn time n another head xn h estimate modified according ph ena en1a en1a ph ph b enb en1b en1b 2m ph dont know ph actual prior probability head multiplier ea half eb thi true every time coin tossed head observed thu whatever initial value estimate n head n ena e0a n enb 2m e0b since eka ekb 1 time k show 05 1 thu 1 2m 2 hence estimate faircoin hypothesi must decrease trial twoheaded coin hypothesi b must increase even though hypothesis compatible string head loose analogy unfair coin atheism fair coin theism observation consistent tail would falsify unfair coin analogou appearance god would falsify atheism claiming analogy extend numerical value variou probability principle constant observation evidence god evidence possible respective theism constantly increase notional estimated probability dont exist important draw distinction theism could supported supported evidence theism cant given theism evidence principle possible doesnt make sense say lack evidence support contrary view quite thi type theism might call g hg term ockham razor discussion id bin ground depend upon ymy conception thi god conception like zeu happened come earth play quite frequently agree lack evidence thi conception god evidence exist ymy conception god one make falsifiable prediction see falsifiable prediction disagree lack evidence support disbelief hypothesis dont falsifiable indeed model theism isnt falsifiable used phrase obverse given specific x theism make prediction px ht 0 used word theism make prediction specific event say believe god happen believe god given x never priorus say px ht 0 even say thi set x x thi dont like ymy use probability also way assigning probability hold science positivistic criterium someone tell measure even principle px h probability applicable hypothesi h case h ht theistic ha atheistic example px ha px hapha pha measure dont dont need analogy know prior probability deduce updating multiplier faircoin hypothesi le unity corresponding multiplier twoheaded coin hypothesi greater unity dont need know initial value running estimate either clear large number observation pfaircoin approach zero ptwoheadedcoin approach unity need know whether px ha larger px ht observed x thi follow assumption certain event rendered possible necessary ht possible ha else equal baysian statistic rely upon series observation hypothesi isnt amenable observation even statement amenable observation observation relevant sequence observation must chosen care im curiou know type observation x1x2 mind concerning theism atheism observation like really doesnt matter affect reasoning provided possible observation would count appearance god example thi might demonstration efficacy prayer veracity revelation statement px h general x still count prediction h theism question ht say prayer may answered miracle may happen see interpretation quoted god exist mean thi prediction px ht 0 x distinguish atheist hypothesi ha predict thi stuff happen px ha 0 x theism make claim px ht 0 x say theism doesnt maybe wa quick say common language said existence god mean notion deity described bible christian interact universe claimed agent agreed thi however must careful believe thi im making claim maybe changed important shift emphasi way since belief conclude px ht 0 x ok well downgrade interact may interact would actually better since interact imply falsifiability agree misplaced dont think theism make prediction maybe im understanding mean prediction could explain mean thi word ill explain bear mind thi isnt central require theism make prediction appearance god never happen atheism somebody point quantum mechanic doesnt make thi prediction either difference qm atheism form partition prediction include statement prayer efficaciou implying stat find prayer efficaciou prayer efficaciou verily say unto thi generation shall pa till thing fulfilled dont think problem misunderstanding persistent observation thi stuff happening consistent ht though may consistent ha explained bayesian stat post even ht god exist unfalsifiable problem argument let number observation go infinity falsify asymptotically btw consider argument require infinite number observation valid rather part argument valid existing human never make infinite number measurment conclusion reily thi dont accept valid fine dont claim theism false merely finite number observation available far suggest continue observe suggestion look better better renormalization stuff deleted bayesian stat post assumed theism wa indeed unfalsifiable finite number observation relevant quote important assumption observation compatible theist hypothesi atheist hypothesi thu would falsify atheism called appearance god thi need taken literally observation require explanation one god exist count observation assumed compatible hypothesis thi leaf theism unfalsifiable atheism falsifiable single observation appearance god problem thi something falsifiable must make prediction x seen x seen hypothesi ha falsified atheism word oposition something theism theism asert belief atheism asert disbelief certain atheism certainly falsifiable certain theism falsifable eg theism assert world 6000 year old god decieve thi ha falsified however atheism oposition unfalsifiable theism also unfalsifiable could wrong thi statment contd think appearance god sufficient falsify atheism wherea general corresponding theism unfalsifiable ill think general question suppse x unfalsifiable notx also unfalsifiable way counterexample let x coin fair accurately notx make sense two side coin different thi unfalsifiable tossing coin even string head consistent fair coin go infinite number toss falsify x limit converse falsifiable falsified least one head least one tail appeared thi partly wrong baysian argument require observation x1 xn made simply observation truth value relation statement god exist use ymy symmetry argument understand someone would say since statement god exist make prediction choose believe none le thi would founded type faith dont like word faith insert belief falsifiable evidence instead ill assume meant god exist highlight agreed definition exist statement make prediction said although isnt falsifiable finite number observation actually mean god exist make prediction oop sorry mea culpa truth thi statment actually depend upon god refering think conception god true im open posibility could wrong give example prediction statment god exist one think true would healing miricle thi principle never determined one way case person seem recover healed without help doctor known reason situation fact happen consistent theistic hypothesi way support hypothesi agree inconsistent atheistic hypothesi cant think one prediction god exist isnt thi type might missing something rapture happen october 28 1992 said rapture would falsified atheism satisfaction happened although failure happen course falsify theism specifically predicted phenomenon require existence one god explanation ever observed sum whole thing bob singleton bobsthnextmitedu cheer simon simon clippingdale simondcswarwickacuk department computer science tel 44 203 523296 university
