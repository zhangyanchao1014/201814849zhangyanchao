society 1876 defined agnostic someone disclaimed strong atheism believed ultimate origin thing must cause unknown unknowable thu agnostic someone believe know sure whether god exist word slippery

atheism beware also word atheist ha many shade meaning difficult generalize atheist say sure atheist dont believe god example certainly isnt case atheist believe science best way find universe philosophical justification basi atheism many philosophical justification atheism find particular person choose atheist best ask many atheist feel idea god presented major religion essentially selfcontradictory logically impossible god could exist atheist scepticism see evidence god exist isnt impossible prove nonexistence something many counterexample statement example quite simple prove exist prime number larger prime number course thi deal welldefined object obeying welldefined rule whether god universe similarly welldefined matter debate however assuming moment existence god provably impossible still subtle reason assuming nonexistence god assume something exist alway possible show thi assumption invalid finding single counterexample hand assume something exist thing question provably impossible showing assumption invalid may require exhaustive search possible place thing might found show isnt exhaustive search often impractical impossible problem largest prime prove dont exist therefore generally accepted must assume thing exist unles evidence even theist follow thi rule time dont believe unicorn even though cant conclusively prove unicorn exist anywhere assume god exist make assumption probably tested make exhaustive search everywhere god might prove doesnt exist anywhere sceptical atheist assume default god exist since assumption test profes strong atheism usually claim sort god exist instead generally restrict claim cover variety god described follower variou religion whilst may impossible prove conclusively god exist may possible prove say god described particular religiou book exist may even possible prove god described presentday religion exist practice believing god described religion exist close believing god exist however sufficiently different counterargument based impossibility disproving every kind god really applicable god essentially nondetectable god interact universe way effect hi interaction must measurable hence hi interaction universe must detectable god essentially nondetectable must therefore case interact universe way many atheist would argue god interact universe importance whether exist bible believed god wa easily detectable israelite surely still detectable today note demanding god interact scientifically verifiable physical way must surely possible perceive effect caused hi presence though otherwise distinguish thing dont exist ok may think philosophical justification atheism isnt still religiou belief one common pastime philosophical discussion redefinition game cynical view thi game follow person begin making contentiou statement person b point cant true person gradually redefine word used statement arrife something person b prepared accept record statement along fact person b ha agreed continue eventually use statement agreed fact use hi original definition word rather obscure redefinition originally needed get b agree rather seen apparently inconsistent b tend play along point thi digression answer question isnt atheism religiou belief depend crucially upon meant religiou religion generally characterized belief superhuman controlling power especially sort god faith worship worth pointing passing variety buddhism religion according definition atheism certainly belief sort superhuman power categorized worship meaningful sense widening definition religiou encompas atheism tend result many aspect human behavimy suddenly becoming classed religiou well science politic watching tv ok religion surely belief atheism science still act faith like religion firstly entirely clear sceptical atheism something one actually believe secondly necessary adopt number core belief assumption make sort sense sensory datum experience atheist try adopt core belief possible even subject questioning experience throw doubt science ha number core assumption example generally assumed law physic observer sort core assumption atheist make basic idea called act faith almost everything know must said based act faith term losis meaning faith often used refer complete certain belief something according definition atheism science certainly act faith course individual atheist scientist dogmatic religiou follower claiming something certain thi general tendency however many atheist would reluctant state certainty universe exist faith also used refer belief without supporting evidence proof sceptical atheism certainly doesnt fit definition sceptical atheism ha belief strong atheism closer still doesnt really match even dogmatic atheist tend refer experimental datum lack asserting god exist atheism religiou surely antireligiou unfortunate human tendency label everyone either friend enemy truth clearcut atheism position run logically counter theism sense said

bible told must call christian obviously extreme sort belief questioned since nobody ha ever proved god exist must unlikely basic religiou belief shared faith nonsense hold wa pointed start thi dialogue positive assertion concerning existence entity inherently much harder disprove negative one nobody ha ever proved unicorn dont exist doesnt make unlikely myth therefore much valid hold
