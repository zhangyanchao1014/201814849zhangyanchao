mvanheyncsindianaedu marc vanheyningen subject ripem frequently noted vulnerability archivename ripemattack lastupdate 31 mar 93 210000 0500 possible attack ripem thi living list potential weakness keep ymy eye open using ripem secure electronic mail go great detail almost certainly exhaustive obviously many weakness weakness cryptographically secured mail general pertain secure mail program ripem maintained marc vanheyningen mvanheyncsindianaedu posted monthly variety news group followup pertaining specifically ripem go altsecurityripem cryptanalysi attack breaking rsa would allow attacker find ymy private key case could read mail encrypted sign message ymy private key rsa generally believed resistant standard cryptanalytic technique even standard key 516 bit ripem long enough render thi impractical barring huge investment hardware breakthrough factoring breaking de would allow attacker read given message since message encrypted de would allow attacker claim de ha 56 bit key thu could conceivably compromised brute force sufficient hardware agency money devote simply read one message since message ha different de key work message would remain high key management attack stealing ymy private key would allow benefit breaking rsa safeguard encrypted de key derived passphrase type however attacker get copy ymy private keyfile ymy passphrase snooping network packet tapping line whatever could break whole scheme main risk transferring either passphrase private key file acros untrusted link dont run ripem trusted machine preferably one sitting right front ideally ymy machine ymy home maybe office nobody else ha physical acces fooling accepting bogu public key someone else could allow opponent deceive sending secret message rather real recipient enemy fool ymy intended recipient well could reencrypt message bogu public key pa along important get proper public key person common mechanism thi finger assuming opponent ha compromised router daemon finger given fair amount trust strongest method key authentication exchange key person however thi alway practical person vouch signing statement containing ymy key possible although ripem doesnt feature thi automatically pgp ripem generate check md5 fingerprint public key key file may exchanged vium separate channel authentication playback attack even opponent break cryptography opponent could still cause difficulty example suppose send message miconly pem mode provide disclosure protection alouse say ok let ymy opponent intercept resend bob ha message authenticated telling course may interpret entirely different context ymy opponent could transmit message recipient much later figuring would seen differently later time opponent could change originatorname register ymy public key hi send message hoping recipient send return mail indicating perhap even quoting unknown message defeat playback attack plaintext message include indication sender recipient unique identifier typically date good frontend script ripem thi automatically imho recipient sure originatorname header sender indicated within plaintext really recipient message old one thi also automated author thi faq ha made modest attempt automating proces generating checking encapsulated header program included standard distribution util directory local attack clearly security ripem greater security machine encryption performed example unix superuser could manage get ymy encrypted mail although would take planning effort something like replace ripem executable trojan horse get copy plaintext depending stored addition link machine running ripem extension decrypt ripem remote machine connected vium network worse yet modem eavesdropper could see plaintext probably also ymy passphrase ripem executed system trust obviously extreme case ripem used ymy machine total control nobody else ha acces ha carefully examined software known free viruse however real tradeoff convenience security moderately cautiou user might use ripem unix workstation person acces even root acces increase security keeping private key statically linked course executable floppy disk person keep ripem multiuser system dialing insecure line download message system perform ripem decryption however security provided mechanism somewhat illusory since presumably type ymy cleartext password log youve given away store since attacker log install trap ymy account steal ymy private key next time use le insecure line thi likely remain situation long system use rather quaint mechanism cleartext password authentication find nice put brief statement carefully manage security arrangement plan next public key potential correspondent aware level precaution place person use two key short one carefully managed ordinary use longer one treated greater care critical correspondence untrusted partner attack ripem encryption ensure person private key corresponding public key used encrypt datum may read traffic however someone key get message may alway make whatever kind transformation wish exist cryptographic barrier recipient say taking encrypted message converting miconly message signed readable anyone although ripem provide thi functionality indeed latest pem draft seen specifically state transformation possible allow forwarding function work including recipient plaintext mentioned make possible recipient redistributed message aware original nature naturally security cryptography never greater security person using
