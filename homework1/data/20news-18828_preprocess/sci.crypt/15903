criminal coercing colluding use person clipper phone restate assumption explicitly amplify argument original title perhap distinction legal illegal cipher system considered harmful clipper considered harmful inaccurate eyecatching current context assumption 1 clipper made available 2 law passed make use cipher system clipper illegal either radio system common carrier system law also include enforcement authority listen acros relevant radio spectrum medium characterize signal validate clipper wrapper detect probable use nonclipper cipher make detection cause action 3 escrowed key useful specific clipper chip must associated suspected criminal thi mean minimum association common carrier unique phone id esn clipper chip serial number n stored government database observed pairing n esn one recorded raise red flag 4 reduce ordinary fraud cellphone system offer clipper also constructed esn mechanism much tamperproof much le spoofable today cellphone 5 criminal want inscrutable communication criminal entirely stupid ignorant figure clipper cellphone offer excellent security normal circumstance offer security law enforcement presumably legitimate wiretap order exist also figure wiretap order must necessarily specific cellphone one ha unique unit key 6 criminal want call attention themself stupid ignorant read netnews know open use nonclipper cipher likely detected generally avoid using nonclipper cipher directly monitorabletappable channel know would raise red flag putting given cellphone given person immediate suspicion 7 impractical reverse engineer skipjack discover family key f construct functional clone clipper chip 2 3 4 7 difficult spoof given clipper phone without immediate detection difficult obscure one association specific phone reprogramming changing chip around criminal motivated find intact phone associated someone else nonstupid criminal conclude clippersecure communication least limited time buy beg borrow steal use someone phone way prevent person reporting compromise phone least time encrypted communication might recorded thu retrievable later criminal delay quite likely evade discovery destroying abandoning phone elapse would unusual innocent person volunteer use clipper phone someone else honest subscriber doesnt want pay someone else bill doesnt want fall suspicion thi leaf two source clipper phone criminal use coercion collusion coercion first theft bear relatively low risk also sometime low time detection minute phone stolen car parked front store couple week phone stolen someone away vacation criminal commerce likely arise stolen clipper phone phone coming riskinured poor criminal cash coming riskaverse wealthy criminal someone extraordinarily motivated gain day two undetected communication like terrorist could kill person hold hostage limited time detection coerced phone useful mean continuing criminal enterprise require continuing supply freshly coerced phone would also created collusive commerce relatively wealthy criminal ignorant dontcare patsy need money submit paid return subscribing clipper phone service someone else use criminal learn advantage coerce use clipper cellphone apply nonclipper cipher normal cellphone call much le attention themself least stolen phone thi way fact phone use coerced must first reported identified interesting phone key obtained escrow clipper also allows extraordinary opportunity criminal conceal use superencryption automated fullsystem surveillance mechanism quite feasible acros radio bandwidth know family key f validate clipper wrapper nesn association reveal realtime use superencryption unles know unit key assured made available two separate piece upon specific wiretaplike order wherea criminal use cipher within normally cleartext medium would stand criminal use nonclipper cipher within clipper medium would difficult detect even ex post facto bulk recording long association criminal specific clipper chip fractured make use thi cipher illegal per se charge criminal thi identify true criminal hell using someone else phone youll evidence help whatever traditional crime might planning even able detect unusual encrypted communication occurring identify specific phone obtain key escrow gangster terrorist thu arguably le secure clipper came along therefore consider clipper harmful 1 provide absolute privacy honest public aggressive dishonest government 2 cipher proscribed engender new type direct criminal threat honest public 3 provide extraordinarily effective mechanism criminal hide use cipher making difficult ever even gain notice unusual communication occurring plan criminal act might progress 4 cipher proscribed lazy investigator prosecutor likely pursue easily quantifiable cipheruse crime traditional directly harmful crime key escrow claimed help 5 cipher proscribed stage set witch hunting illegal cipher use computer used cipher machine brad yearwood bradoptilinkcom uunet
