ciphertextonly attack file encrypted crypt one source cbw ftpcb use compression encryption number person proposed perfect compression followed simple encryption method eg xor repeated key unfortunately compres perfectly know exact distribution possible input practical purpose impossible describe typical english text beyond coarse characteristic singleletter frequency build sophisticated model ymy input enemy ha slightly accurate model hell able find redundancy ymy compressed output note nearly practical compression scheme unles designed cryptography mind produce output actually start high redundancy example output unix compres begin wellknown threebyte magic number serve entering wedge cryptanalysi thi say compression encryption inherently bad idea ha done carefully mean remove need strong encryption compression encryption silly unbreakable cipher ye onetime pad unbreakable see part 4 unfortunately onetime pad require secure distribution much key material plaintext course cryptosystem need utterly unbreakable useful rather need strong enough resist attack likely enemy whatever length time datum protect expected remain valid random mean cryptography cryptographic application demand much pseudorandom number generator application source bit cryptographically random must computationally impossible predict nth random bit given complete knowledge algorithm hardware generating stream sequence 0th n1st bit n lifetime source software generator also known pseudorandom ha function expanding truly random seed longer string apparently random bit thi seed must large enough guessed opponent ideally also truly random perhap generated hardware random number source sparcstation 1 workstation could example generate random number using audio input device source entropy connecting anything example cat devaudio compres foo gife file high entropy random much randomnes one encrypt file using part key example convert seed entropy pseudorandom string looking hardware device provide thi entropy important really measure entropy rather assume look complicated human must random example disk operation completion time sound like might unpredictable many person spinning disk much like clock output completion time relatively low entropy unicity point aka unicity distance see sha49 unicity distance approximation amount ciphertext sum real information entropy corresponding source text encryption key equal number ciphertext bit used ciphertext significantly longer thi shown probably unique decipherment thi used back claim validity ciphertextonly cryptanalysi ciphertext significantly shorter thi likely multiple equally valid decryption therefore gain security opponent difficulty choosing correct one unicity distance like statistical informationtheoretic measure make deterministic prediction rather gife probabilistic result namely minimum amount ciphertext likely single intelligible plaintext corresponding ciphertext possible key tried decryption working cryptologist dont normally deal unicity distance instead directly determine likelihood event interest let unicity distance cipher character fewer ciphertext character intercepted enough information distinguish real key set possible key de ha unicity distance 175 character le 3 ciphertext block block correspond 8 ascius character thi may seem alarmingly low first unicity distance gife indication computational work required find key approximately character intercepted fact actual cryptanalysi seldom proceed along line used discussing unicity distance like measure key size unicity distance something guarantee insecurity small doesnt guarantee security high practical cryptosystem absolutely imperviou analysi manner characteristic might serve entering wedge crack cipher message however similar informationtheoretic consideration occasionally useful example determine recommended key change interval particular cryptosystem cryptanalyst also employ variety statistical informationtheoretic test help guide analysi promising direction unfortunately literature application information statistic cryptanalysi remain classified even seminal 1940 work alan turing see koz84 insight possibility see kul68 goo83 key management important one fundamental axiom cryptography enemy full possession detail general cryptographic system lack specific key datum employed encryption course one would assume cium make habit telling mossad cryptosystem mossad probably find anyway repeated use finite amount key provide redundancy eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress thu especially modern communication system vast amount information transferred party must sound cryptosystem also enough key material cover traffic key management refer

relatively compact generator perhap simplest example linear congruential sequence one popular type random number generator obviou dependence seed output unfortunately graph sequence high enough
