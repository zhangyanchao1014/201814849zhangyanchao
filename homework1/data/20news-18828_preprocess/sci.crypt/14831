mvanheyncsindianaedu marc vanheyningen subject ripem frequently asked question archivename ripemfaq lastupdate 31 mar 93 220000 0500 thi posting thi listing likely question information ripem program public key mail encryption thi faq ripem wa written maintained marc vanheyningen mvanheyncsindianaedu posted variety newsgroup monthly basi followup discussion specific ripem redirected group altsecurityripem new running world wide web archive ripem information contain much anything isnt available elsewhere ha convenient pointer current version thi faq stuff url httpcsindianaeduripemdirhtml thi month version ha fair amount new pointer information patent stuff like ive also reordered thing sensible ordering hope dont edit thi soon disclaimer nothing thi faq considered legal advice anything one layperson opinion want real legal advice talk real lawyer preferably one experience patent law export regulation whatever area law question list question 1 ripem 2 get ripem 3 ripem run machine 4 ripem work mailer 5 rsa 6 de 7 fingerprint like md5 8 pem 9 thi distributing authenticating key 10 isnt bad idea use patented algorithm standard like pem 11 rsadsipkp 12 ripem public key look similar 13 pgp 14 rpem 15 mime 16 tispem 17 thi simple way defeat security ripem question answer 1 ripem ripem yet complete useful implementation privacy enhanced mail pem ripem allows ymy electronic mail fmy security facility provided pem disclosure protection optional originator authenticity message integrity measure nonrepudiation origin alway see pem ripem wa written primarily mark riordan mrrscss3clmsuedu code public domain except rsa routine library called rsaref licensed rsa datum security inc current version ripem 105 current version macintosh port ripem 07 2 get ripem ripem use library cryptographic routine rsaref considered munition thu exportrestricted distribution person citizen permanent resident u canada without export license license ha obtained would one likely granted unles rsa key exchange shortened 512 bit symmetric cipher changed something weaker de suggestion thi situation may change clinton office author request readme file thi law violated please export cryptographic code thi distribution outside usa canada thi personal request author ripem condition ymy use ripem note rsaref public domain license included distribution read using ripem ripem available vium anonymou ftp citizen permanent resident u rsacom cd rsaref read readme file info note nonrsaref portion ripem product rsa datum security incorporated merely

binary many architecture available addition full source tree 3 ripem run machine probably ha already ported msdo flavor unix suno next linux aix ultrix solari etc port macintosh include standard unixstyle port rather nice maclike port written raymond lau author stuffit port expected help user invited 4 ripem work mailer probably easy clean effective interface depend sophistication modularity mailer though user guide included distribution discus way use ripem many popular mailer including berkeley mush elm mh code also included elisp allow easy use ripem inside gnu emac make new interface ripem create improvement one distribution believe convenient use secure may useful feel free post altsecurityripem 5 rsa rsa crypto system asymmetric publickey thi mean two different related key one encrypt one decrypt one reasonably derived may publish ymy encryption public key widely keep ymy decryption private key anyone use ymy public key encrypt message hold private key needed decrypt note message sent rsa normally de key real plaintext see de note provide disclosure protection originator authenticity message integrity nonrepudiation origin service implemented fingerprint message see fingerprint like md5 encrypted sender private key recipient disputeresolving authority use sender public key decrypt confirm message must come sender wa altered rsa wa named three man rivest shamir adleman invented find lot rsa modern cryptography general ftp rsacom look pubfaq information also may scicrypt 6 de de datum encryption standard widely used symmetric secretkey crypto system unlike rsa de use key encrypt decrypt message however de much faster rsa ripem use de rsa generate random key encrypt ymy mail de using key encrypt key recipient public rsa key include result letter allowing recipient recover de key de sometime considered weak somewhat old use key length considered short modern standard however reasonably safe opponent smaller large corporation government agency likely pem standard incorporate support symmetric cipher near future strong feeling pem stable become utilized widely without early problem interoperability 7 fingerprint like md5 md5 message digest algorithm produced rsa datum security inc provide 128bit fingerprint cryptographically secure hash plaintext cryptographically secure possible reasonable amount computation produce different plaintext produce fingerprint thu instead signing entire message sender private key md5 message need signed authentication md5 also exchanged directly authentication example ripem public key include md5 public key file party wishing confirm key authentic vium separate channel merely need exchange md5 key verify accuracy md5 sometime used purpose example often used map input arbitrary length 128 bit datum passphrase interpreter cookie generator md5 described entirety including implementation c rfc 1321 recent suggestion md5 may strong hash wa originally believed presumably hash function used thi accepted true 8 pem pem privacy enhanced mail standard allowing transfer encrypted electronic mail generated long period time working group expert described rfc 14211424 document approved obsolete old rfc 11131115 ripem really complete implementation pem pem specify certificate authenticating key ripem handle thi time addition planned 9 thi distributing authenticating key remote user able send secure mail must know ymy public key able confirm message received came must know public key important thi information accurate bad guy convince hi key fact send message read ripem allows three method key management central server distributed finger server flat file three described ripem user guide part distribution none provide perfect security pem standard call key management certificate addition thi feature ripem planned chickenegg issue still exist 10 isnt bad idea use patented algorithm standard like pem thi issue ha considered standard proces rfc 1310 specification internet standard ha discussion section 6 specification nondiscriminatory availability must met patented method included standard rfc 1421 address thi issue regard patent covering publickey cryptography thi course mean

interested issue unfortunately distributed separately program difficult find u ftp site due liability concern 14 rpem rpem stand rabin privacy enhanced mail wa similar ripem used publickey cipher invented rabin rsa attempt avoid patent publickey system wa written mark riordan later wrote ripem distribution wa halted contrary belief many including rabin pkp claimed patent broad enough cover
