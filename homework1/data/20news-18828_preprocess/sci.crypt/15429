statement pres secretary president today announced new initiative bring federal government together industry voluntary hum att vlsi mykotronx industry wonder happened ibm thi right street mandateed scheme voluntary mr orwell would love thi program improve security privacy telephone communication meeting legitimate need law enforcement telephone encryption scrambleing year behind digital one like rsa idea even de literaly true clasic strawman claim context nonrealtime circuit email like initiative involve creation new product accelerate development use advanced secure telecommunication network wireles communication link would modestly propose mandated use isdn would commun ication thi lot long ha little dialogue private sector law enforcement community resolve tension economic vitality real challenge protecting american rather use technology accommodate sometime competing interest economic growth privacy law enforcement previou policy pitted government industry right privacy law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology ha used year protect electronic fund transfer used protect electronic mail computer file encryption normmaly de technology help american protect busines secret unauthorized release personal information also used terrorist drug dealer criminal note use word busines whole tenor thi release seem establishing ground rule busines use legitimate debate want nothing drop ymy wife ear remain secret private even agenda debate note role contain private info thi reference information already hand unauthorized release bit also drawing long bow case person legitimate acces abusing revealing often selling info person course thi proposal person key criminal also use lawer court cium whitehouse official pen go busines outlawed well yeah several would better idea clipper protection law court seriously erroded last decade ofr stateoftheart microcircuit called clipper chip ha developed government engineer chip represent nsa new approach encryption technology yeah thi bit true used new relatively inexpensive encryption device attached ordinary telephone scramble telephone communication using encryption algorithm powerful many commercial use today note repeated mixing telephone scrabeling encryption demo claim ordanary pot would good night entertainment suspect note also many general tone imply thi new technology help company protect proprietary information protect privacy personal phone conversation prevent unauthorized release datum transmitted electronically time thi technology preserve ability federal state local law enforcement agency intercept lawfully phone conversation criminal case record seem indicate needed brutal tightening current bus heard yet case wa impeaded use secure encryption man black side abuse law enforcer well documented even govt agency phone v com blurred yet keyescrow system established ensure clipper chip used protect privacy lawabiding american keyescrow system established ensure clipper chip used protect privacy lawabiding american let run line twice carefully say stated purpose key eschrow make use clipper compulsory note word ensure protect lawabiding leave person asked included outlawing encryption answer thi pres release ye device containing chip two unique key number needed authorized government agency decode message encoded device device manufactured two key deposited separately two keyescrow datum basis established attorney general acces key limited government official legal authorization conduct wiretap wiretap warrent clipper chip technology provide law enforcement new authority acces content private conversation american make sure illegal one preserved demonstrate effectivenes thi new technology attorney general soon purchase several thousand new device addition respected expert outside government offered acces confidential detail algorithm ass capability publicly report finding find many expert ex kgb person looking contract later posting ask stuiii already interesting see military u embasy start use secure isnt govt answer point action chip important step addressing problem encryption dualedge sword encryption help protect privacy individual industry also shield criminal terrorist need clipper chip approach provide lawabiding citizen acces encryption need prevent criminal using hide illegal activity order ass technology trend explore new approach like keyescrow system president ha directed government agency develop comprehensive policy encryption accommodate privacy citizen including need employ voice datum encryption busines purpose personal use seem unaskable question ability authorized official acces telephone call datum proper court legal order necessary protect citizen ah warrent alway needed seem effective timely use modern technology build national information infrastructure needed promote economic growth competitivenes american industry global marketplace need u company manufacture export high technology product itar seem slightly impeed thi president ha directed early frequent consultation affected industry congres group advocate privacy right individual policy option developed administration committed working private sector spur development national information infrastructure use new telecommunication computer technology give american unprecedented acces information thi infrastructure highspeed network information superhighway transmit video image hdtv programming huge datum file easily today telephone system transmit voice note thi wonderfull stuff secret proper person able expres opinion hence desired result emerge since encryption technology play increasingly important role infrastructure federal government must act quickly develop consistent comprehensive policy regarding use administration committed policy protect american right privacy also protecting break law encryption code around millenium generaly equilibrium technology time systematic study cypher ha resulted swing favor encrypter moment doubt factoring problem fall time probably fofr practical purpose middle next century information provided accompanying fact sheet provision president directive acquire new encryption technology also available additional detail call mat heyman national institute standard technology 301 9752758 question answer clinton administration telecommunication initiative q thi approach expand authority government agency listen phone conversation clipper chip technology provide law enforcement new authority acces content private conversation american q suppose law enforcement agency conducting wiretap drug smuggling ring intercept conversation encrypted using device would decipher message would obtain legal authorization normally court order wiretap first place would present documentation thi authorization two entity responsible safeguarding key obtain key device used drug smuggler key split two part stored separately order ensure security key escrow system q run keyescrow datum bank two keyescrow datum bank run two independent entity thi point department justice administration yet determine agency oversee keyescrow datum bank little hard critisise nonproposal q strong security device sure strong security thi system secure many voice encryption system readily available today note drop back phonemode thi true answer rephrased suck big time anyone drive crypt workbench use light amusement breakfast algorithm remain classified protect security key escrow system thi link security keyeschrow actual algorithm real winner given 2 secret 40 bit number could someone please explain detail encryption algorithm reveal willing invite independent panel cryptography expert evaluate algorithm assure potential user unrecognized vulnerability make sure read cv real carfully ok q whose decision wa propose thi product national security council justice department commerce department key agency involved thi decision thi approach ha endorsed president vice president appropriate cabinet official quick looking back name missing list q wa consulted congres industry ongoing discussion congres industry encryption issue expect discussion intensify carry review encryption policy briefed member congres industry leader decision related thi initiative person agree u think buck q government provide hardware manufacturer government designed developed key acces encryption microcircuit providing microcircuit product manufacturer product manufacturer acquire microcircuit chip manufacturer produce reverse engineering provision maskwork act could relevent q provide clipper chip mykotronx program facility torrance californium sell chip encryption device manufacturer programming function could licensed vendor future q buy one encryption device expect several manufacturer consider incorporating clipper chip device dont unles one right person q administration unable find technological solution like one proposed would administration willing use legal remedy restrict acces powerful encryption device thi fundamental policy question considered broad policy review key escrow missed word secret need grammar lesson mechanism provide american encryption product secure convenient le expensive readily available today one piece must comprehensive approach encryption technology administration developing would say le secure le conveniant expensive pgp free le available prone comprimised proof contarary welcome note proof administration saying since encryption threaten public safety effective law enforcement prohibit outright country effectively done u saying every american matter right entitled unbreakable commercial encryption product dont seem saying anything make much sense thi proposal prohibit except limited way thi one explicit reference personal right denial ye dont think mexican brazilian canuck included clinton et al magnanamou gesture false tension created assessment thi issue eitheror proposition rather concern fact harmoniously balanced reasoned balanced approach proposed clipper chip similar encryption technique false tension false balance two repugnant point right privacy handwaved nonexistance putting behind false assessment assumed removal right take ever step deem suitable protect ymy privacy non negotiable hence defined govenment language nonexistant dont agree must criminal criminal dont agree law also note non question wa possible q thi decision indicate clinton administration policy toward encryption differ bush administration indicate understand importance encryption
