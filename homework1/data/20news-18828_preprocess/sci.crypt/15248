practice many person still using cryptosystem relatively easy break cryptology cryptography plaintext ciphertext encryption key story begin juliu caesar sent message hi trusted acquaintance didnt trust messenger replaced every c every b alphabet someone knew shift 2 rule could decipher hi message cryptosystem cipher system method disguising message certain person see disguise cryptography art creating using cryptosystem cryptanalysi art breaking cryptosystemsseeing disguise even youre supposed able cryptology study cryptography cryptanalysi original message called plaintext disguised message called ciphertext encryption mean procedure convert plaintext ciphertext decryption mean procedure convert ciphertext plaintext cryptosystem usually whole collection algorithm algorithm labelled label called key instance caesar probably used shift n encryption several different value n natural say n key person supposed able see disguise called recipient person enemy opponent interloper eavesdropper third party reference start learn cryptology introduction technical matter survey article given part 10 best place begin general concise authored competent person well written however article mostly concerned cryptology ha developed last 50 year abstract mathematical historical codebreaker kahn kah67 encyclopedic history technical detail cryptology mid60 introductory cryptanalysi learned gaine gai44 sinkov sin66 thi recommended especially person want devise encryption algorithm since common mistake try make system knowing break one selection algorithm de drew attention many public researcher problem cryptology consequently several textbook book serve text appeared book denning den82 gife good introduction broad range security including encryption algorithm database security acces control formal model security similar comment apply book price davy pri84 pfleeger pfl89 book konheim kon81 meyer matya mey82 quite technical book konheim meyer directly involved development de book give thorough analysi de konheim book quite mathematical detailed analysis many classical cryptosystem meyer matya concentrate modern cryptographic method especially pertaining key management integration security facility computer system network book rueppel rue86 koblitz kob89 concentrate application number theory algebra cryptography one go cryptanalysi classical cryptanalysi involf interesting combination analytical reasoning application mathematical tool pattern finding patience determination luck best available textbook subject military cryptanalytic series frie1 clear proficiency cryptanalysi part gained attempted solution given system experience considered valuable cryptanalyasis performed wwius ally still classified modern publickey cryptanalysi may consist factoring integer taking discrete logarithm traditional fare cryptanalyst computational number theorist successful cryptanalyst public key system bruteforce search cryptographic relevance nutshell fx know compute f find x trying every possible x bruteforce search example say cryptanalyst ha found plaintext corresponding ciphertext doesnt know key simply try encrypting plaintext using possible key ciphertext matchesor decrypting ciphertext match plaintext whichever faster every welldesigned cryptosystem ha large key space thi bruteforce search impractical advance technology sometime change considered practical example de ha use 10 year ha 256 1017 possible key computation thi many operation wa certainly unlikely user mid70 situation different today given dramatic decrease cost per processor operation massively parallel machine threaten security de brute force search scenario described garron outerbridge gar91 one phase sophisticated cryptanalysi may involve bruteforce search manageably small space possibility property satisfied every strong cryptosystem security strong system reside secrecy key rather attempt keep algorithm secret strong cryptosystem ha large keyspace mentioned unicity distance measure gife minimum amount ciphertext must intercepted uniquely identify key key unicity distance much longer amount ciphertext intend encrypt key system probably strong strong cryptosystem certainly produce ciphertext appear random standard statistical test see example cae90 strong cryptosystem resist known previou attack system ha never subjected scrutiny suspect system pas test mentioned necessarily strong certainly many weak cryptosystem looked good first however sometime possible show cryptosystem strong mathematical proof joe break thi system also solve wellknown difficult problem factoring integer see part 6 failing crap shoot cryptosystem theoretically unbreakable guaranteed analysisproof practice cryptanalytic method include known practical cryptanalysi enemy doesnt stare ymy ciphertext figure plaintext instance might assume cribsstretch probable plaintext crib correct might able deduce key decipher rest message might exploit isologsthe plaintext enciphered several cryptosystem several key thu might obtain solution even cryptanalytic theory say doesnt chance sometime cryptosystem malfunction misused onetime pad example losis security used even chosenplaintext attack enemy somehow feed plaintext encryptor deduce key employed see kah67 many person still using cryptosystem relatively easy break dont know better often amateur think design secure system aware expert cryptanalyst could sometime insufficient motivation anybody invest work needed crack system
