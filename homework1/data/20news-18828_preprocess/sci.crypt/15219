technology accommodate sometime competing interest economic growth privacy law enforcement previou policy pitted government industry right privacy law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology ha used year protect electronic fund transfer used protect electronic mail computer file encryption technology help american protect busines secret unauthorized release personal information also used terrorist drug dealer criminal stateoftheart microcircuit called clipper chip ha developed government engineer chip represent new approach encryption technology used new relatively inexpensive encryption device attached ordinary telephone scramble telephone communication using encryption algorithm powerful many commercial use today thi new technology help company protect proprietary information protect privacy personal phone conversation prevent unauthorized release datum transmitted electronically time thi technology preserve ability federal state local law enforcement agency intercept lawfully phone conversation criminal keyescrow system established ensure clipper chip used protect privacy lawabiding american device containing chip two unique 2 key number needed authorized government agency decode message encoded device device manufactured two key deposited separately two keyescrow datum basis established attorney general acces key limited government official legal authorization conduct wiretap clipper chip technology provide law enforcement new authority acces content private conversation american demonstrate effectivenes thi new technology attorney general soon purchase several thousand new device addition respected expert outside government offered acces confidential detail algorithm ass capability publicly report finding chip important step addressing problem encryption dualedge sword encryption help protect privacy individual industry also shield criminal terrorist need clipper chip approach provide lawabiding citizen acces encryption need prevent criminal using hide illegal activity order ass technology trend explore new approach like keyescrow system president ha directed government agency develop comprehensive policy encryption accommodate privacy citizen including need employ voice datum encryption busines purpose ability authorized official acces telephone call datum proper court legal order necessary protect citizen effective timely use modern technology build national information infrastructure needed promote economic growth competitivenes american industry global marketplace need u company manufacture export high technology product president ha directed early frequent consultation affected industry congres group advocate privacy right individual policy option developed 3 administration committed working private sector spur development national information infrastructure use new telecommunication computer technology give american unprecedented acces information thi infrastructure highspeed network information superhighway transmit video image hdtv programming huge datum file easily today telephone system transmit voice since encryption technology play increasingly important role infrastructure federal government must act quickly develop consistent comprehensive policy regarding use administration committed policy protect american right privacy also protecting break law information provided accompanying fact sheet provision president directive acquire new encryption technology also available additional detail call mat heyman national institute standard technology 301 9752758 question answer clinton administration telecommunication initiative q thi approach expand authority government agency listen phone conversation clipper chip technology provide law enforcement new authority acces content private conversation american q suppose law enforcement agency conducting wiretap drug smuggling ring intercept conversation encrypted using device would decipher message would obtain legal authorization normally court order wiretap first place would present documentation thi authorization two entity responsible safeguarding key obtain key device used drug smuggler key split two part stored separately order ensure security key escrow system q run keyescrow datum bank two keyescrow datum bank run two independent entity thi point department justice administration yet determine agency oversee keyescrow datum bank q strong security device sure strong security thi system secure many voice encryption system readily available today algorithm remain classified protect security key escrow system willing invite independent panel cryptography expert evaluate algorithm assure potential user unrecognized vulnerability q whose decision wa propose thi product national security council justice department commerce department key agency involved thi decision thi approach ha endorsed president vice president appropriate cabinet official q wa consulted congres industry ongoing discussion congres industry encryption issue expect discussion intensify carry review encryption policy briefed member congres industry leader decision related thi initiative q government provide hardware manufacturer government designed developed key acces encryption microcircuit providing microcircuit product manufacturer product manufacturer acquire microcircuit chip manufacturer produce q provide clipper chip mykotronx program facility torrance californium sell chip encryption device manufacturer programming function could licensed vendor future q buy one encryption device expect several manufacturer consider incorporating clipper chip device q administration unable find technological solution like one proposed would administration willing use legal remedy restrict acces powerful encryption device thi fundamental policy question considered broad policy review key escrow mechanism provide american encryption product secure convenient le expensive readily available today one piece must comprehensive approach encryption technology administration developing administration saying since encryption threaten public safety effective law enforcement prohibit outright country effectively done u saying every american matter right entitled unbreakable commercial encryption product false tension created assessment thi issue eitheror proposition rather concern fact harmoniously balanced reasoned balanced approach proposed clipper chip similar encryption technique q thi decision indicate clinton administration policy toward encryption differ bush administration indicate understand importance encryption technology telecommunication computing committed working industry publicinterest group find innovative way protect american privacy help business compete ensure law enforcement agency tool need fight crime terrorism q device exportable device use government hardware voice encryption device subject export control requirement casebycase review export
