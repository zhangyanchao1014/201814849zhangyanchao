cryptosystem strong contrast purpose mathematical cryptology precisely formulate possible prove statement cryptosystem strong say example cryptosystem secure passive attack nontrivial attack system defined slow practical prove thi statement confidence cryptosystem resist passive cryptanalytic technique reduce thi statement wellknown unsolved problem still confidence cryptosystem isnt easy break part cryptology also amenable mathematical definition point explicitly identify assumption making prove produce desired result figure mean particular cryptosystem used properly mean assumption valid methodology useful cryptanalysi cryptanalyst take advantage incorrect assumption often try construct proof security system see proof fail use failure starting point hi analysi onetime pad secure definition onetime pad cryptosystem plaintext ciphertext key string say byte string length ekp sum let say exclusive k p easy prove mathematically nontrivial singleciphertext attack onetime pad assuming uniform distribution key note dont assume uniform distribution plaintext proof let attack ie algorithm taking two input f g producing one output h probability p h hp whenever f fp g gekp ie g gk p distribution k uniform independent p distribution k p must also uniform independent p also distribution c uniform independent p hence probability exactly p h hp whenever f fp g gc p c thu fortiorus trivial hand onetime pad secure key k used one plaintext ie nontrivial multipleciphertext attack properly used key k must thrown away one encryption key also called pad thi explain name onetime pad ciphertextonly attack notation ciphertextonly attack one f constant given information gekp1ekpn n ciphertext attack ha chance producing information hp1pn plaintext attack trivial ha good chance producing hp1pn given gc1cn random c1cn example say gc c say hp first bit p easily write attackthe guessing attack simply guess hp 1 thi attack trivial doesnt use ciphertext ha fiftyfifty chance guessing correctly matter hand attack rsa produce one bit information p 100 succes using c fed random c succes rate drop 50 thi nontrivial attack knownplaintext attack classic knownplaintext attack ha fp1p2 p1 gc1c2 c1c2 hp1p2 depending p2 word given two ciphertext c1 c2 one decryption p1 knownplaintext attack produce information decryption p2 note knownplaintext attack often defined literature producing information key thi pointles cryptanalyst generally care key insofar let decrypt message chosenplaintext attack chosenplaintext attack first increasingly impractical series active attack cryptosystem attack cryptanalyst feed datum encryptor attack dont fit model passive attack explained anyway chosenplaintext attack let cryptanalyst choose plaintext look corresponding ciphertext repeat ha figured decrypt message absurd example thi sort attack chosenkey attack chosensystem attack much important form active attack message corruption attack attacker try change ciphertext way make useful change plaintext many easy way throw kink attack instance automatically encrypting plaintext p tekhtrprp timekey sequence number chosen anew message r random number h oneway hash function comma mean concatenation plu mean exclusiveor mathematical term say bruteforce attack consider following knownplaintext attack given plaintext p1pn1 ciphertext c1cn1 also given ciphertext cn run every key k find k ekpus cu every n print dkcn n big enough one key work thi attack succeed valid input time produce correct result blue moon random input thu thi nontrivial attack problem slow many possible key keyguessing attack entropy say somebody using onetime padbut isnt choosing key randomly uniformly mbit message wa supposed security proof fact say known prefer key english word cryptanalyst run english word possible key thi attack often succeed much faster bruteforce search entire keyspace measure bad key distribution calculating entropy thi number e number real bit information key cryptanalyst typically happen acros key within 2e guess e defined sum pk log2 pk pk probability key k
