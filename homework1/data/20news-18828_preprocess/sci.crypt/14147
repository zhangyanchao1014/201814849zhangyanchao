marc vanheyningen mvanheyncsindianaedu subject ripem frequently asked question archivename ripemfaq lastupdate sun 7 mar 93 210000 0500 thi posting thi still rather rough listing likely question information ripem program public key mail encryption thi faq ripem wa written maintained marc vanheyningen mvanheynwhalecsindianaedu posted variety newsgroup monthly basi followup discussion specific ripem redirected group altsecurityripem thi month reformatted thi posting attempt comply standard hypertext faq formatting allow easy manipulation thi document world wide web let know think disclaimer nothing thi faq considered legal advice anything one person opinion want real legal advice talk real lawyer question answer 1 ripem ripem program perform privacy enhanced mail pem using cryptographic technique rsa de allows ymy electronic mail property authentication ie sent confirmed privacy ie nobody read except intended recipient ripem wa written primarily mark riordan mrrscss3clmsuedu code public domain except rsa routine library called rsaref licensed rsa datum security inc 2 get ripem ripem contain library cryptographic routine rsaref considered munition thu exportrestricted distribution person citizen permanent resident u canada therefore following request quoted readme file please export cryptographic code thi distribution outside usa canada thi personal request author ripem condition ymy use ripem note rsaref public domain license included distribution read using ripem best way get ask friend copy since thi reduce load site carry mention human run naturally thi require trust friend ripem available vium anonymou ftp citizen permanent resident u rsacom cd rsaref read readme file info last looked thi site contain source tree contain compiled binary nice mac version ripem well crypt stuff ha home site rpubclmsuedu open nonanonymou ftp user u canada citizen permanent resident find obtain acces ftp cd pubcrypt read file gettingacces convenience binary many architecture available addition full source tree 3 ripem run machine probably ha already ported msdo flavor unix suno next linux aix ultrix solari etc port macintosh include standard unixstyle port rather nice maclike port written raymond lau author stuffit port expected help user invited 4 ripem work mailer probably easy clean effective interface depend sophistication modularity mailer though user guide included distribution discus way use ripem many popular mailer including berkeley mush elm mh code also included elisp allow easy use ripem inside gnu emac make new interface ripem create improvement one distribution believe convenient use secure may useful feel free post altsecurityripem 5 rsa rsa crypto system asymmetric publickey thi mean two different related key one encrypt one decrypt one reasonably derived may publish ymy encryption public key widely keep ymy decryption private key anyone use ymy public key encrypt message hold private key needed decrypt note message sent rsa normally de key real message see de note provide privacy authentication fingerprint message see fingerprint like md5 encrypted sender private key recipient use sender public key decrypt confirm message must come sender rsa wa named three man rivest shamir adleman invented find rsa ftp rsacom look pubfaq look scicrypt 6 de de datum encryption standard widely used symmetric secretkey crypto system unlike rsa de use key encrypt decrypt message however de much faster rsa ripem use de rsa generate random key encrypt ymy mail de using key encrypt key recipient public rsa key include result letter allowing recipient recover de key de sometime considered weak somewhat old use key length considered short modern standard however reasonably safe opponent smaller large corporation government agency unlikely future ripem strengthen symmetric cipher possibly using multiple encryption de 7 pem ripem relate pem privacy enhanced mail system allowing easy transfer encrypted electronic mail described rfc 14211424 document approved obsolete old rfc 11131115 ripem really complete implementation pem pem specify certificate authenticating key ripem handle thi time addition planned 8 thi distributing authenticating key remote user able send secure mail must know ymy public key able confirm message received came must know public key important thi information accurate bad guy convince hi key fact send message read ripem allows three method key management central server distributed finger server flat file three described ripem user guide part distribution none provide perfect security 9 ripem public key look similar ripem public key begin pkc identifier describing variou characteristic key first bunch character ymy key may lot people key thi mean ymy key similar clas key generated program length etc 10 fingerprint like md5 md5 message digest algorithm produced rsa datum security inc provide 128bit fingerprint cryptographically secure hash plaintext cryptographically secure possible reasonable amount computation produce different plaintext produce fingerprint thu instead signing entire message sender private key md5 message need signed authentication md5 sometime used purpose example often used map input arbitrary length 128 bit datum passphrase interpreter cookie generator md5 described entirety including implementation c rfc 1321 11 pgp pgp another cryptographic mail program called pretty good privacy pgp ha around longer ripem work somewhat differently pgp compatible ripem way though pgp also use rsa major difference pgp ripem pgp ha key management feature particularly user without direct network connection ripem conform pem rfc thu ha greater probability working pem software pgp make attempt compatible anything pgp fact pgp 10 compatible pgp 20 ripem use rsaref library rsa routine rsa datum security inc rsaref come license allows noncommercial use pgp use implementation rsa licensed thu pkp firm holding u patent rsa algorithm claim infringement patent make use sell pgp u canada acknowledgement thi pgp original author phil zimmermann say documentation fact live usa federal agency shouldnt actually run pgp ymy computer public key partner want forbid running software pgp contraband pgp ripem exportrestricted sent outside u canada however pgp already exist many ftp site europe place whether use pgp ripem whatever documentation pgp recommended reading anyone interested issue note fact regarding patent export restriction somewhat controversial many person think shouldnt way person interpret variou document differently unfortunately discussion net inevitably seem produce heat light probably belong misclegalcomputing see disclaimer 12 rpem rpem stand rabin privacy enhanced mail wa similar ripem used publickey cipher invented rabin rsa attempt avoid patent rsa wa written mark riordan author ripem distribution wa halted contrary belief many including rabin public key partner pkp claimed patent wa broad enough cover publickey cipher whose strength rested difficulty factoring product large prime rsa thi claim universally accepted mean wa challenged pragmatic reason rpem really used anymore compatible ripem pgp 13 mime mime stand multipurpose internet mail extension described rfc 1341 find newsgroup compmailmime pem interact mime yet entirely clear person use stopgap solution mime type applicationxripem order send ripem message mime one hope standard emerge draft internet document exist matter 14 thi simple way defeat security ripem may wish check companion post ripemattack discus obviou attack ripem security procedure minimize risk ripem main weak area probably key distribution
