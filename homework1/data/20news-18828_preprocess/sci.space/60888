23 1993 introduction order increase public interest spacebased lunar operation real miniature lunarlike environment constructed test teleoperated model model remotelycontrolled individual located worldwide using personal computer edutainment purpose thi provide testbed simple teleoperation telepresence activity also provide sharing information method operating space including limited layout lunar colony teleoperating machine work play disseminating educational information providing contest award creativity achievement provide new way student worldwide participate twentyfirst century remote learning method nature ltm1 project person age interest skill contribute scenery mural model structure interfacing electronic software graphic operation ltm1 evolving playground laboratory used child student professional worldwide using personal computer home terminal participating institution user able teleoperate real model ltm1 base experimental recreational purpose real facility exist ample opportunity provided medium coverage construction lunar model operation new feature added suggested user themself thi ha broad inherent interest wide range group teleoperation virtual reality research radio control model railroad ham radio operation astronomy space planetarium science center art theater bb online network user software game developer manufacturer retailer model rocket car train child child u ltm1 overall design room 14 foot 8 foot contain base lunar layout wall used mural distant moon mountain star field view earth floor simulated lunar surface global call contribution hereby made material lunar surface design creation scale model lunar colony element scenery machinelet ltm1 initial design ha 3 teleoperated machinelet 1 ssto scale model able lift hover land 2 bulldozerlet able move quarry area 3 moontrain traverse simulated lunar surface machinelet ha small tv camera utilizing ccd tv chip mounted personal computer digitize image including reducing picture content datacompression allow minimal image sent operator control purpose also return control signal first machinelet set moontrain since model train tv camera built almost offtheshelf item control electronic starting stopping train minimal user receive image every 1 4 second depending speed datum link ltm1 next ssto scale model ccd tv chip suspended servomotor operated wire frame mounted ceiling allowing ssto controlled operator take hover entire lunar landscape land finally tank model modified ccd tv chip equipped bulldozerlet entire initial ltm1 allow remote operator worldwide receive minimal image actually operating model landing takeoff traveling work entire system based commercially available item part easily obtained except interface electronic well within capability many advanced ham radio operator computer hardwaresoftware developer taking graphically oriented communication program dmodem adding teleoperation screen control necessary user interface provided 80 man hour plan action diaspar virtual reality network ha agreed sponsor thi project providing host computer network internet acces network diaspar providing 14 foot 8 foot facility actual construction lunar model diaspar ha stock electronic tank modified one ccd tv chip diaspar also agree provide rail stock lunar train model diaspar make available dmodem graphical communication package modify control machineslet initial ground breaking miniature shovel performed live photosession news conference april 30 1993 initial model put place timelapse record started historical purpose expected thi event completely seriou solemn lunar colony declared open additional building operation experiment photographer present photograph taken converted gif image distribution worldwide major online network bb pres release issued calling contribution idea time talent material scale model simulated lunar colony contest new design technique working moon announced university invited participate goal find instructor wish clas participation variou aspect lunar colony model field trip ltm1 arranged time result clas work added model contributor able teleoperate contributed machinelet return campu monthly ltm1 newsletter issued electronically online vium conventional mean medium major new teleoperated equipment addition marked invitation television news medium large real model space colony attractive photo opportunity television community especially since action controlled person world science fiction writer invited issue challenge engineering human factor student university build operate teleoperated equipment perform lunar task using counterweight pulley system 16 gravity may simulated extent try variou traction challenge long term goal creating worldwide interest education experimentation remote operation lunar colony ltm1 ha potential long term global edutainment method space activity may generic example teach explore many subject area limited space edutainment thi facilitate kind spirit lead generation person ready leap star conclusion edutainment blending education entertainment anyone ha ever enjoyed seeing miniature probably see potential impact globally available layout recreation education experimentation purpose creating teleoperated model lunar colony create worldwide publicity also method trying new idea require real virtual skill open new method putting people mind space moonlighter illuminating path knowledge space lunar development following person already engaged variou part thi work david42 rob47 dash hyson jzer0 vril wyatt dark one
