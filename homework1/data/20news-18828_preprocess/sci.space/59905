yamada yamadayscvaxyscgojp u planetary mission mariner venu mar mercury flyby orbiter mariner 1 first u attempt send spacecraft venu failed minute launch 1962 guidance instruction ground stopped reaching rocket due problem antenna onboard computer took control however turned bug guidance software rocket promptly went course range safety officer destroyed although bug sometime claimed incorrect fortran statement wa actually transcription error bar indicating smoothing wa omitted expression rdotbar sub n nth smoothed value derivative radiu thi error led software treat normal minor variation velocity seriou leading incorrect compensation mariner 2 became first successful probe flyby venu december 1962 returned information confirmed venu hot 800 degree fahrenheit revised 900 degree f world cloudcovered atmosphere composed primarily carbon dioxide sulfuric acid wa later confirmed 1978 mariner 3 launched november 5 1964 wa lost protective shroud failed eject craft wa placed interplanetary space unable collect sun energy power solar panel probe soon died battery ran solar orbit wa intended mar flyby mariner 4 mariner 4 sister probe mariner 3 reach mar 1965 took first closeup image martian surface 22 flew planet probe found cratered world atmosphere much thinner previously thought many scientist concluded thi preliminary scan mar wa dead world geological biological sense mariner 5 wa sent venu 1967 reconfirmed datum planet collected five year earlier mariner 2 plu information venu atmospheric pressure surface least 90 time earth equivalent 3300 foot surface ocean mariner 6 7 sent mar 1969 expanded upon work done mariner 4 fmy year earlier however failed take away concept mar dead planet first made basic measurement mariner 4 mariner 8 ended atlantic ocean 1971 rocket launcher autopilot failed mariner 9 sister probe mariner 8 became first craft orbit mar 1971 returned information red planet probe done revealing huge volcano martian surface well giant canyon system evidence water flowed acros planet probe also took first detailed closeup image mar two small moon phobo deimo mariner 10 used venu gravity assist mercury 1974 probe return first closeup image venusian atmosphere ultraviolet revealing previously unseen detail cloud cover plu fact entire cloud system circle planet fmy earth day mariner 10 eventually made three flyby mercury 1974 1975 running attitude control ga probe revealed mercury heavily cratered world much greater thought thi would seem indicate mercury ha iron core make 75 percent entire planet pioneer moon sun

1974 went become first probe study saturn 1979 vehicle continue function 1995 heading interstellar space first craft ever pioneer venu 1 1978 also known pioneer venu orbiter pioneer 12 burned venusian atmosphere october 8 1992 pvo made first radar study planet surface vium probe pioneer venu 2 also known pioneer 13 sent fmy small probe atmosphere december 1978 main spacecraft bu burned high atmosphere fmy probe descended parachute toward surface though none expected survive surface day probe make transmitted 675 minute ground battery failed ranger lunar lander impact mission ranger 1 2 test probe ranger lunar impact series meant high earth orbit testing 1961 rocket problem left useles low orbit quickly decayed ranger 3 launched january 26 1962 wa intended land instrument capsule surface moon problem launch caused probe mi moon head solar orbit ranger 3 try take image moon flew camera wa unfortunately aimed deep space attempt ranger 4 launched april 23 1962 purpose ranger 3 suffered technical problem enroute crashed lunar farside first u probe reach moon albeit without returning datum ranger 5 launched october 18 1962 similar ranger 3 4 lost solar panel battery power enroute eventually missed moon drifted solar orbit ranger 6 9 modified lunar mission send back live image lunar surface headed toward impact moon ranger 6 failed thi objective 1964 camera operate ranger 7 9 performed well becoming first u lunar probe return thousand lunar image 1965 lunar orbiter lunar surface photography lunar orbiter 1 5 designed orbit moon image variou site studied landing area manned apollo mission 19691972 probe also contributed greatly understanding lunar surface feature particularly lunar farside five probe series launched 1966 1967 essentially successful mission first u probe orbit moon lo eventually crashed lunar surface avoid interference manned apollo mission surveyor lunar soft lander surveyor series designed primarily see apollo lunar module could land surface moon without sinking soil thi time wa feared moon wa covered great layer dust would support heavy landing vehicle surveyor wa successful proving lunar surface wa strong enough hold spacecraft 1966 1968 surveyor 2 4 unsuccessful mission rest became first u probe soft land moon taking thousand image scooping soil analysi apollo 12 landed 600 foot surveyor 3 1969 returned part craft earth
