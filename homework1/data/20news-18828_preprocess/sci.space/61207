launch demand late 1990 early february arianespace released annual market survey detailed projection space transportation market next decade short run arianespace expect retain dominant position sustain majority share launch market 54 international commercial launch planned 1995 ariane hold contract 31 general dynamic atla vehicle hold 14 contract mcdonnell dougla deltum hold 7 great wall long march vehicle hold 2 launch contract threequarter future launch contract ariane compete projected come communication satellite remaining 25 split weather earth observation scientific satellite future telecommunication demand growth predicted come asiapacific region arianespace expect current market consolidation individual satellite operator regional national group continue group investing heavier satellite larger communication payload carrying transponder arianespace predict average telecommunication satellite increase 20 today average level 3000 kg geo demand commercial launch service expected remain strong next three year second half decade arianespace predict demand decrease arianespace basis thi prediction upon matching satellite transponder demand supply particularly new datum compression technique appear could double triple transponder capacity using existing nearterm transponder one significant possible change market wa identified arrival new launch vehicle including russian launch system arianespace predict long term investor purchasing launch service looking best trade launch service quality price russian new launch service prove capability service quality market penetration minimal commentary ariane release market survey annually reported prior market survey past issue csnstus comparing two survey arent outstanding difference number notable change consideration new datum compression technique reducing demand new physical transponder orbit note contrast prediction demand space based communication transponder appear remain strong fiber optic line making substantial inroad established pointtopoint telecommunication market growing demand telecommunication service world wide pointto multipoint broadcast service prevented decrease space transponder demand fiberoptic cable provide higher capability service established point established point b establish fiberoptic link necessary install cable point improved network solution installing large network distributed fiberoptic link cost million billion dollar broadcast service existing ground network structure satellite still offer cost effective solution new service required new region cheaper install small satellite link costing ten thousand dollar tie existing global satellite network thi allows rapid growth new satellite service ha kept demand high replacement market fiberoptic growing well since demand grow point serviced become cost effective later install fiberoptic link handle increase traffic since telecommunication datum transfer market still growing rapidly satellite market projection remain rosy satellite also getting longer orbital lifetime current generation satellite getting guarantee 15 year onorbit service contrast 10 year service last generation satellite thi ha cut back launch demand satellite owner rescheduling replacement satellite launch longer interval last note arianespace didnt flag thi year look like space transportation market rather supplied existing launch system near term annual commercial launch demand 1520 medium sized satellite per year supply side ariane capable launching dozen medium sized satellite year deltum capable 912 per year atla capable 612 long march 48 japan hvehicle 24 russia proton capable 8 system zenit soyuz another 1020 medium launch per year lot capability small market expect competition intensify commercial

officer halt mission wa overridden pegasu wa launched violation range safety rule last minute pegasu launch countdown one two abort command receiver aboard pegasu failed failure typically scrub launchand nasa range safety officer wallop island va issued mission abort order minute scheduled pegasu launch somehow thi command wa overridden osc launch team message wa lost communication channel pegasu wa launched despite valid abort call fortunately pegasu functioned expected abort command receiver wa needed thi incident spark investigation since valid abort order wa given agreedto launch constraint rule wa obeyed leading investigation national transportation safety board ntsb support nasa osc air force thi investigation mark first time ntsb ha taken lead incident involving space launch according ntsb investigation take 6 month primarily looking line authority communication link safety procedure used launch commentary thi first time ntsb ha led investigation space launch leadership wa requested department commerce office commercial space transportation licensed commercial launch time writing thi column initial investigation concluded result starting leak trade pres apparently 3 fmy different communication channel use test abort destruct receiver stopped responding nasa test director range controller mission control room wallop island gave abort order minute launch according mission rule thi stopped launch somehow osc test conductor ordered abort reversed nasa communicator net relayed order b52 carrying pegasu 22 second launch differing explaination exactly thi happened proposed best set clear line communication clear definition responsibility mission control team understanding mission rule established launch see commercial launch procedural issue going crop resolved thi case interesting first time ntsb ha called investigate commercial launch problem commercial aircraft problem think thi problem turn primarily problem procedure communication cleared issuance guideline launch communication set specific line authority delineated 7 another pegasu competitor announced tsniimach enterprise russium announced marketing new small
