nasa headquarters station redesign team srt provided detailed statu report advisory committee redesign space station april 22 daylong meeting wa held anser facility crystal city va topic covered srt included preliminary mission goal statement space station science technology engineering research assessment proces design approach discussion management option operation concept also held design team presented three option study µ option modular buildup pete priest presented option priest said team working define station meet cost goal ha identified three distinct phase evolution power station human tended permanent presence team define minimum capability needed achieve phase total cost phase achievable capability budget level option use current simplified freedom hardware cost effective considering existing system socalled bus1 spacecraft orbiter spacelab power station capability could achieved 3 flight freedom photo voltaic module providing 20 kw power 30day shuttlespacelab mission
