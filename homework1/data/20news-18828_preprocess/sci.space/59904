kennedy space center official nasa shuttle statu report posted scispacenews frequently shuttle roll liftoff following answer translation provided ken jenk kjenksgothamcityjscnasagov ascent guidance flight control training manual asc gc 2102 say vertical rise phase launch pad attitude commanded iloaded vrel sufficient assure launch tower clearance achieved tilt maneuver roll program orient vehicle head attitude required generate negative qalpha turn alleviate structural loading advantage thi attitude performance gain decreased abort maneuver complexity improved sband look angle crew view horizon tilt maneuver also required start gaining downrange velocity achieve main engine cutoff meco target second stage thi really good answer couched nasa jargon ill try interpret 1 wait shuttle clear tower rolling 2 roll shuttle around angle attack wind caused passage atmosphere relative wind chord wing imaginary line leading edge trailing edge slightly negative angle negative qalpha thi cause little bit downward force toward belly orbiter z direction thi force alleviate structural loading careful wing theyre delicate part vehicle 3 new attitude roll also allows u carry orbit achieve higher orbit change orbit higher lower inclination would case didnt roll performance gain 4 new attitude allows crew fly le complicated flight path execute one dangerou abort maneuver return launch site decreased abort maneuver complexity 5 new attitude improve ability groundbased radio antenna good lineofsight signal sband radio antenna orbiter improved sband look angle 6 new attitude allows crew see horizon helpful mandatory part piloting flying machine 7 new attitude orient shuttle body nearly parallel ground nose east usually thi allows thrust engine add velocity correct direction eventually achieve orbit remember velocity vector quantity made speed direction shuttle ha large horizontal component velocity small vertical component attain orbit thi beg question isnt launch pad oriented give thi nice attitude begin shuttle need roll achieve attitude answer pad leftover apollo day shuttle straddle two flame trench one solid rocket motor exhaust one space shuttle main engine exhaust see effect thi daytime launch srm exhaust dirty gray garbage ssme exhaust fluffy white steam watch difference top orbiter side bottom external tank side stack acces tower support service structure oriented basically way saturn v side note saturn v also roll program dont ask im shuttle guy checked buddy ascent dynamic added roll maneuver really maneuver three axe roll pitch yaw roll component maneuver performed reason stated pitch component control loading wing keeping angle attack qalpha within tight tolerance yaw component used determine orbital inclination total maneuver
