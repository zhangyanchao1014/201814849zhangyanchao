pharveyquackkfucom paul harvey subject sabbath admission 5of5 wrote response dlecointgarnetacnsfsuedu dariuslecointe clear much need said faq think paul comment esteeming one day another rom 14 probably need said wa paul god interpretation word paul higher priority direct word jesu matt51419 paul begin roman 14 someone weak faith count one weak faith accept dariu honor lord wish might equally accept esteem day alike similarly best honor lord ye bible say jesu say paul close roman 14 hand person doubt something eat anyway guilty isnt acting hi faith failure act faith sin gau isbn0933999992 read ten commandment portion law read jesu word matt51419 doubt ymy mind right sin greek hamartium missing mark however id like clear think unambiguou proof regular christian worship wa first day indicated response passage cited wherea ten commandment jesu word matt51419 fairly clear difficulty passage actually something else look like talking nnregular christian meeting neither explicitly say gathered every sunday worship get variou piece information nothing aimed answering thi question matt51419 doesnt answer ymy question day christian met house act 207 despite dariu confusion described act occuring sunday doesnt say gathered see paul gathered breaking bread breaking bread roughly synonymou eating think obviou reading thi first day every week simply mean every time gather worship unite thi concept ten commandment jesus word matt51419 think reason implication clear statement nt author assumed reader knew christian worship wa clh assumed ten commandment jesu word matt51419 actually stood something perhap strong faith dont believe paul overrule god however paul wa writing largely gentile audience law wa regarded jew time binding jew gentile rule binding human socalled noachic law quite minimal issue church face jesu death wa gentile wanted follow christ decision impose law didnt say law wa abolished simply acknowledged fact didnt apply gentile thu contradiction mat 5 far tell paul jewish christian continue participate jewish worship sabbath thu continued obey law issue wa gentile christian covered law least ceremonial aspect jesu dealt mostly jew think reasonably assume mat 5 wa directed jewish audience interact gentile time eg centurion whose slave wa healed couple term used describe centurion see luke 7 suggest wa godfearer ie gentile followed god adopted whole jewish law wa commended jewish elder worthy person jesu accepted thi seem indicate jesu accepted prevailing view gentile need accept law however involved want compare jesu paul law order get full picture role law come grip paul apparent rejection law relate jesu commendation law least read paul say law serve purpose ha certain sense superceded thi issue isnt one abolition law middle hi discussion paul note might understood thi way assure u intend say rather see law primarily present convict person sinfulnes ultimately impossible standard one ha superceded christ paul comment world clearest everyone agree reading interesting thing notice even thi radical position entail abolition law still remain uncompromising standard iotum dot may removed purpose convicting sin important relaxed however christian end ultimately live faith law theoretical category use rather different end think jesu paul come rather similar conclusion quoted passage mat 5 taken context rest sermon mount jesu show u interpret law iotum dot would suggest rather literal reading fact jesu approach jesu interpretation emphasize intent law stay away ceremonial detail indeed well known taking rather free attitude toward sabbath kosher law scholar claim mat 51720 need taken context 1st cent jewish discussion jesu accuse hi opponent caring giving tenth even minor herb neglecting thing really matter justice mercy faith caring cup plate cleaned fact inside person use full extortion rapacity mat 232325 thi discussion later mat 5 suggest jesu ha specific view law mind talk maintaining law full strength thinking aspect paul conclusion similar talk law superceded specific example gife involve ceremonial law circumcision sabbath quite concerned maintaining moral standard net result thi paul talk law superceded jesu talk law maintained believe talking different aspect law paul embroiled argument circumcision natural letter responding specific situation looking aspect law currently causing trouble law specifically jewish ceremoney certainly intend abolish divine standard conduct hand jesu commend law seem talking law broadest implication moral human relationship deemphasizing aspect later give paul much trouble unfortunate person use term different way familiar current conflict look way term like family value take special meaning current context imagine poor historian future trying figure family value used code word opposition homosexuality one specific period u think law taken similar role argument paul wa involved paul wa clearly rejecting jewish value go along term law person concerned family value movement really opposed family value clh
