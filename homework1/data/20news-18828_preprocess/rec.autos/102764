article contain question geared automotive enthusiast crossposted miscconsumer rpw change 14 april 1993 revised brake fluid section nonsilicone dot5 fluid apparently available rpw commonly asked automotive question tire question q funny number side tire mean typically see something like 19560hr14 195 overall width tire millimeter tread usually narrower 60 aspect ratio indicate height sidewall tire relative overall width example tire ha sidewall height 060 195 117 mm 14 wheel diameter inch also special tire called trx tire three digit metric wheel diameter designation like 390 millimeter r mean radial h speed rating indicating highest speed tire properly inflated carrying appropriate load may safely operate common speed rating 112mph 118mph h 130mph v 150mph recent change method specifying tire size move speed rating different part designation may therefore find designation like 19560r14 85h 85 indicate pertire load associated speed rating exceeding thi load continuou operation rated speed dangerou practice follow table showing number load index corresponding maximum pertire load load index 50 51 88 89 112 113 145 149 157 max load kg 190 195 560 580 1120 1150 2900 3250 4125 note usual v weight confusion occur thi table case letter p lt may found front tire size lt designation indicate light truck p designation indicate passenger car letter given application tire passenger car usage far know letter appear u market lt designation prinicipally interest owner light truck utility vehicle owner passenger vehicle meaningful difference tire p designation one designation aspect ratio omitted probably 80 may 78 tire mudsnow designation may speed rating reduced 20 kmh 12mph additional set rating tire temperature traction treadwear temperature traction graded b c best c worst treadwear numeric rating value limited value assigned somewhat arbitrarily tire manufacturer thu useful comparing different brand tire q car ha tire funny size designation 18565hr390 put normal tire car ymy tire called trx tire devised michelin somewhat different bead design incompatible normal tire michelin used different diameter wheel could mounted wrong type wheel conventional tire could mounted trx type wheel need aquire different wheel put normal tire ymy car barely possible fit normal tire trx wheel horribly dangerou tire may simply peel rim corner possibly blow high speed trx type tire becoming hard find addition michelin avon make suitable tire goodyear ha apparently discontinued line trx tire q rotate radial side side rotate one side car car tire manufacturer differing view thi subject many say swapping radial left right hand side car ok thi group include michelin goodyear example pirelli nokium void warranty swapping done best advice read ymy tire manual carefully rotating ymy tire stick manufacturer recommendation q many snow tire buy buy 2 end car put short 4 end explain many driver area dont get excessive snow dont drive agressively snow condition get away two snow drive wheel circumstance thi dangerou practice rear wheel drive car choose able start car going function rear axle stopping turning car function front axle front wheel drive car start stop turn front end primary risk putting snow tire front put brake going downhill run seriou risk going downhill backward radar detector speed limit q arent comment radar detector speed limit thi qa posting question detector speed limit crossposted miscconsumer recauto alway start long tediou pointles flame war want talk either topic please subscribe recauto altflame keep safety equipment q airbag really work preliminary statistic suggest following airbag work much better belt good 3 point belt alone work much better airbag alone airbag 3 point belt work slightly better 3 point belt alone con airbag design tend burn driver hand venting byproduct explosion occur inside bag design may knock driver hand wheel making retention control vehicle bag deflate difficult brake question q alway need get rotor disk brake turned mida alway want thi specific condition mandate turning replacing rotor shop try make little extra money replacing rotor often strictly necessary rotor warped warped lightly grooved need replace turn note also rotor rotor many honda good example narrow begin practical turn must replaced become thin warped badly grooved q tell downshift braking slow car thi really good idea used good idea back day mediocre fade prone drum brake modern disc brake equipped car use downshifting slow car really necessary except case long steep downhill run otherwise modern disc brake adequate stop passenger car circumstance much cheaper repair clutch lining hand many standard driver license test usa still specify driver tested downshift braking suggest taking u driver test either 1 learn thi smoothly take time practice 2 borrow car automatic take test q often replace brake fluid probably often traditional brake fluid tend absorb water thi water corrode internal part brake system also lower boiling point fluid dot3 type older fluid dot4 dot5 newer specification principal difference wet dry boiling point dry boiling point important fresh brake fluid wet boiling point important older brake fluid dot3 fluid lowest wet dry boiling point requirement dot4 fluid better boiling point requirement dot5 fluid best boiling point requirement dot5 fluid clearly superior see next qa detail requirement imply dot4 fluid better dot3 fluid may specific case dot3 fluid preferable mostly competition application otherwise dot4 type fluid offer much improved brake pedal feel replacement year recommended dot4 fluid although agressive driver may profit changing fluid frequently least bleeding modest amount fluid brake caliper fairly regularly q dot5 brake fluid thi break two part dot5 specification look excellent performance first dot5 fluid silicone based silicone fluid tricky proposition unlike dot3 dot4 fluid absorb water thi may sound like feature problem water present pool system interfering braking performance corroding metal spot pooling occuring water tend migrate downward braking system brake caliper corrosion occur thi phenomenon essential converting silicone empty entire brake system flush throughly beforehand even recommend replacing rubber part brake system converting silicone fluid two issue come silicone fluid 1 difficult pmy cleanly without air bubble interfere getting good brake pedal feel 2 generally much higher boiling point dot4 fluid high temperature failure mode indistinguishable effect boiling dot4 fluid silicone fluid may make sense street car application certainly recommended high performance driving application economic questionable street use recently become aware new fluid meet dot5 standard contain silicone fluid appear reasonably compatible older dot3 dot4 fluid little information thi time q ab available car im looking cost worth thi cut dried answer therefore thi answer quite long order cover pro con short answer ab cost initially maintain generally work better average driver say driver extensive experience high performance driving technique may require unlearning obsolete braking technique like pump braking unlearned case long answer ab work monitering wheel car looking sign locked brake may may able able distinguish different wheel several system market detect impending lockup would really want ideal world existence lockup sensor used vary le well designed sensor sensitive tire size brake pad material may cease function properly owner deviate original equipment oeequivalent component sensor detect lockup ab system respond unlocking brake either individually depending system driver keep foot firmly planted ab end cycling locked unlocked state sensor existed could detect impending lockup could sit right point maximum braking effect achieved thi pulsing often felt brake pedal system cycle percentage time brake truly engaged called duty cycle typically ab system thi 40 dry pavement trained driver beat thi duty cycle quite reliably using technique called threshold braking wet pavement braking chancy ab outperform threshold braking nearly every time unfortunately mud snow often maximum braking effect acheived brake locked audi manufacturer producing absequipped car ha seen fit provide disable switch ab system thi eventuality particularly important feature ab preserve steering control thi case simply braking near limit turn wheel ab release brake see steeringtriggered lockup back percentage time brake applied braking distance lengthen accordingly important caution ab exceed maximum theoretical braking force given situation start sliding glare ice dont expect ab system help much coefficient friction changed presence ab system ymy car far maintenence go addition potential restriction ive listed worry following 1 part cost much higher oe master cylinder obscure european sedan list 185 oe master cylinder absequipped version car list 1000 manufacturer explicitly forbid use dot5 silicone brake fluid absequipped vehicle potential cost replacement corroded brake system component regular suggest annual replacement brake fluid become important q thi threshold braking busines normally id put thi consumer qa recent publicity number accident involving polouse driver absequipped chevy caprice suggest thi section needed rpw threshold braking technique practiced seriou high performance driver made habit replace stab pedal lock em panic habit entirely much prefered basically premise tire generate maximum braking force started slide wheel lock entirely driver threshold brake learn feel thi threshold feel like learn search hit application brake pedal many car feel near threshold pedal start firm depres case cant hear tire whine bit youre near threshold car ab often twinge pedal system start cycling driver back pedal tad twinge felt close threshold theyll probably achieve better stopping distance punched let ab take recently ha rash publicity number accident one death involving polouse car equipped ab system polouse department question quickly blamed new ab system according autoweek magazine seem clear problem wa lack training none involved officer recent performance driving training reason believe driver reacted pulsing brake pedal pump braking old discredited technique stabbing releasing brake pedal goal try get brake back failing hydraulic system think minute youll realize pump braking must cut effective operation working brake system least 12 cut 40 duty cycle ab system much giving ymy brake wrong reason threshold braking ha advantage effective useful technique regardles whether ymy car ha ab fear failed hydraulic system one two stab pedal sufficient ga question q high octane gasoline help maybe maybe car knock sensor adjust engine timing turbocharger boost suit gasoline used car however use cheapest ga make ymy car run well check ymy owner manual detail ymy car need q car wa made leaded gasoline unleaded ga hurt possible unleaded ga may slightly increase valve wear although amoco oil company argue otherwise actual increase valve wear almost unnoticeable however modern leaded gasoline actually contain little lead however check ymy owner manual many car early 1970 actually require leaded gasoline q fuel treatment help kind use dont winter good idea use dry ga however may harmful fuel injection system never use additive containing methanol sometime called methyl alcohol additive may damage fuel system car carb almost certainly damage car fuel injection manufacturer opinion vary additive containing ethanol sometime called ethyl alcohol ymy car ha fuel injection check owner manual ymy car using manufacturer consider 10 ethanol acceptable gasoline additive isopropyl alcohol isopropanol petroleum distillate fine fuel injected car occasional bottle fuel injector cleaner helpful car fuel injector although many premium gasoline contain detergent job brand fuel injector cleaner contain ethanol methanol alway check ingredient putting anything ymy ga tank small number particularly good additive noticeably expensive runofthemill one work much much better among chevron techron redline sl1 wurth lubrimoly ventil sauber bg 44k bottle one every six month highly recommended q detergent gasoline quality detergent package gasoline vary somewhat bmw ha instituted testing program gasoline brand pa thi test may advertise fact sticker indicating passage test beginning appear fuel pump ga station gasoline used fuel injector cleaner probably optional beforewarned use bmw approved gasoline keep clean engine clean may clean motor bad valve deposit lubrication question q number letter motor oil designation mean several different item encoded twoletter code indicating type detergent package manufacturer use oil thi look like sesfcd code gasoline engine application c code diesel engine application second letter assigned sequence new level protection developed thu sf considered better se se considered better sd forth noticeable designation oil weight thi either single number eg 30 weight pair number separated letter w eg 10w30 latter type much commonly used day type automobile manufacturer specify operator manual first number designation 10w apparent viscosity oil cold w stand winter second number 30 viscosity oil hot trick oil doesnt actually get thicker turn 10 weight 30 weight get hotter actually happening oil cold ha viscosity cold 10 weight oil get hotter doesnt get thin fast 10w oil would time temperature ha viscosity hot 30 weight oil note number actually specify range viscosity 10w oil exactly viscosity cold 30 weight oil viscosity hot note also novel behavimy multigrade oil caused additive ha reported sole exception castrol gtx 10w40 oil retain multigrade characteristic well time 10w30 15w40 20w50 oil work well though q quick lube place good adequate work quite incompetent one let buyer beware watch work make sure dont overtorque oil drain plug keep ymy hand ymy wallet time q oil additive like slick50 tufoil good slick50 tufoil ptfebased additive many come onto market recently different molybased additive around since early 50 ptfe chemical name teflontm trademark owned dupont general auto manufacturer recommend use product usenet response question additive favorable slight increase mpg application smoother revving long term result whether ptfe additive effective 5k mile debatable manufacturer saab claim either product engine flush preceed application cause deterioration oil seal eventual leakage bmw owner reported death valve seal shortly addition slick 50 car thi writer ha cautioned slick50 dealer slick50 used japanese motor may clog oil return passage engine otherwise known report damage caused ptfe additive hand satified slick 50 customer world q synthetic oil really work ye specifically auto manufactuer accept synthetic disagree extremely long oil change interval claimed oil manufacturer auto manufacturer recommend continue change oil interval recommended owner manual ymy car even decide try longer interval least change oil filter regular interval synthetic get dirty conventional oil synthetic gear lubricant manual transmission another matter entirely amsoil redline agip highly regarded effective mobil 1 synthetic gear lube get mixed review however q manufacturer specifying longer longer oil change interval often change oil depend drive ymy car alway nearly alway get warmed dont drive hard keep rev manufacturer recommendation probably fine however drive hard drive high rev alternatively drive supermarket doesnt get temperature may wish change oil much often perhap 3000 mile interval given manufacturer specifying 7500 mile interval dont drive ymy car much say 7500 mile year probably want change oil every six month anyway storing car winter change oil storing change oil bring storage misc question q car ha timing belt hear bad thing happen break story depend internal design motor early ford escort example suffer severe valve damage belt break newer car require tow installation new belt honda motor damaged replacement interval specified ymy car change belt least every 60000 mile car may require frequent replacement ask ymy dealer independent mechanic also ask related repair take place time example ford escort suffer valve damage also timing belt driven water pump ha known seize destroying timing belt cause major valve damage side effect replacing timing belt ignoring water pump costly mistake q would anyone stupid enough design motor self destruct timing belt break performance reason compromising piston design valf piston collide require compression ratio engine reduced significantly thi likely avoid valve damage economy car performance oriented vehicle q cause unintended acceleration final report national highway transportation safety administration concluded unintended acceleration could caused mechanical failure vehicle question time consistent physical evidence nhtsa report go conclude pedal misapplication vehicle operator probably cause richard welty 5183937228
