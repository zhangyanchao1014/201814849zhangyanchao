90 c quattro audi 100c fwd quite happy report s4 servotronic inoffensive suppose due fat gumball tire servotronic ha loaded thi far ha best implementation tried far perfect mind id much happier wa option could refuse s4 longer consider thi bad enough feel entire car ruined steering still tad light accurate suppose stiffly sprung chassis send back much information make driver hand feel accuracy s4 steering also room improvement consider s4 steering better japanese competition primarily japanese believe feel engineer completely 2 engine wheee pressure cooker 110 mile clock expect s4 producing anywhere close putting 10000 mile later still car pack terrific punch turbocharged machine unusual encourage lazy driving ie low rev high gear supremely flexible one could hardly believe 22 liter displacement move thi 3700 pound car around fashion maximum torque available 1950 rpm 7200 rpm redline car pretty much left third day translate speed range something like 20100 mph chracteristic one normally associate large capacity v8 technical achievement breadthtaking throttle response right good atmospheric engine fact would even put peaky multivalve engine shame downshift almost unnecessary fun use overboost feature rev engine familiar s4 engine feature 15 second additional turbo boost passing sort like lighting burner jet fighter one could right foot third gear blast car 30 80 moment simply flooring ga far number go maximum torque available overboost mode shoot 270 lb ft incredible 22 liter take moment develop overboost well worth waiting since thi quite heavy car one body part flung around like say corrado vr6 acceleration smooth strong somewhat similar riding jetliner accelerate runway takeoff also one treated distinctive entertaining whistle turbo entertaining sound come refined bland sounding 5 banger ye audi ha refined 5 point 7200 rpm sound serene 2000 smoothnes outstanding quite standard good 6 eg 12 valve bmw id say term refinement ie willingnes rev smoothnes lack harshnes full acceleration better many v6 however lost refinement proces characteristic 5 cylinder bark made older engine characterful terribly refined 20 valve turbo 5 sound pretty bland except whistle full boost subjectively id rate vw vr6 engine far musical turbo 5 also audi v8 also far musical rorty race car growl pressed though none match grunt hint engine true capacity occur one taking rest turbo ha come near stop extra inertium permanently engaged 4wd system one ha somewhat delicate feeding clutch prevent embarassing stall alternately one could use rev case small price pay fantastic engine think audi america offer automatic option thi car offer though extremely small number 5 speed much peakier v8 characteristic engine perfect automatic ironically europe slush available none offered land slush marketing twit rearing ugly head 3 chassis ive noticed audi tend wide wheel relatively modest tire width car come firestone size 22550 zr16 uncommon however attractive 5 spoke wheel le 8 inch wide sidewall bulge whatsoever combined flared wheel arch s4 ha mouth watering macho yet subdued look rough concrete become immediately clear new 100 body style ha made significant advance structural rigidity well road noise suppression suppose two interrelated digres use cliche s4 body feel like ha carved stone flex totally undetectable even going rough road super rigid body like thi stiff spring stiff damper cause excessive harshnes s4 ride quality never worry lexu also draw comparison truck pony car servotronic steering ha already mentioned consider inoffensive inhibit spirited cornering wa able test car cornering power without much trepidation think new concept work thi car fat gumball tire talking understeer oversteer practically meaningles banked highway ramp went slow started applying power went around could feel g force build point skin face wa tugged sideway yet car wa totally completely obedient throttle steering input felt limit even close approached g force thrilling entire affair going around curve strangely uninvolving tell car want end story think starting relate reviewer highly impressed honda nsx clinical efficiency unable fall love car brake good firmnes stop car pretty well though ive read prone fade surprised since s4 uprated brake base audi 100 fwd harder pad would help turn would lead wooden response cold starting see trend among luxurysport sedan maker extra weight offset additional braking capacity ls400 fade performance nothing brag neither q45 legend brake fade day seem forgotten virtue everybody attention focused antilock capability 4 comfort car sporty ability comfort level also excellent cabin beautifully appointed carbonfiber panel insert place wood trim 92 s4 expected gizmo heated seat power seat seat memory power thi glaring ommision wa trip computer wa removed audi hasnt gotten work reliably yet mean car ha boost gauge real disappointment taking account much turbo dominate performance unusual german s4 come honda style moonroof well intelligent dialasunroofposition rotary switch noise level including engine tire noise low wouldnt consider lexu advantage thi area significant enough sway potential buyer 5 conclusion even though able afford audi s4 sticker price 48k car bargain one take account ha offer competition 20 valve turbo 5 real gem even doesnt produce ferrarus sound
