question general consumer interest broken facilitate crossposting miscconsumer rpw last change 8 february 1993 ct permit radar detector usage new tiretraction qa rpw commonly asked question radar question q radar detector illegal u currently virgina district columbium prohibit usage radar detector new york prohibit use large truck canada illegal manitoba ontario quebec newfoundland pei prince edward island apparently illegal europe legislation would make illegal pending many jurisdiction chance legislation passing vary great deal q radar detector detector used really work usage spreading rapidly initially used canada appearing new york virginium unsafe assume use connecticut dc work detecting certain frequency radiated many currently available super het radar detector brand detector radiate strongly thu likely spotted new radar detector becoming available may detected current generation detector detector note detector may spotted one device turned q vascar kind radar vascar nothing fancy stopwatch timespeeddistance computer depend operator pressing button target vehicle pas landmark radar signal emitted vascar system q ka band radar used radar detector able handle ka band ha recently made available fcc use u socalled photoradar installation installation lowpowered beam aimed acros road 45 degree angle direction traffic picture taken vehicle radar unit determine violation speed limit ticket mailed owner vehicle low power 45 degree angle many person believe radar detector give reasonable warning ka band radar unit although manufacturer radar detector added capability anyway number locale photoradar use limited question legality unit best advice learn photo radar unit look like keep track used else dont speed q radar jammer work legal quick answer usa detailed answer cheap radar jammer work well jammer work expensive usually property military jammer major violation regulation federal communication commission usa driving technique vehicle dynamic question q understeer oversteer understeer oversteer term describing behavimy car cornering near limit limit adhesion driver normally drive hard enough term descriptive situation encounter simply put tell whether car want go straight corner steer le understeer want turn corner oversteer understeer commonly designed production car untrained driver inadvertantly traveling fast wont get trouble understeer may also induced using much throttle corner oversteer designed performance oriented car may induced lifting throttle trailing throttle oversteer tto extreme case lifting throttle may induce much oversteer car react fishtailing spinning technical detail corner speed tire car develop called slip angle slip angle angular difference direction car traveling direction steering wheel directing car travel understeer front wheel greater slip angle rear wheel oversteer rear wheel greater slip angle front wheel q revmatched downshift downshifting engine must rotating faster lower gear wa higher gear however downshift normally declutch lift ymy foot throttle rev drop rather increase revmatched downshift blip throttle reengaging clutch engine already new speed thi result much smoother faster downshift q heelandtoe mean heelandtoe technique used revmatched downshift braking thi normally challenging need right foot brake throttle called heelandtoe use one end foot brake throttle match rev downshift many modern car thi misnomer often must use ball foot brake right side throttle note race car driver skip clutch use left foot brake right foot throttle accomplishing thing q doubleclutch downshifting ymy right foot ymy left foot one three thing nothing declutch declutch twice reason declutching twice match speed two shaft transmission speed engine thi usually coupled revmatching engine neutral clutch engaged throttle blipped shaft transmission speed procedure follow 0 declutch 1 move gearshift lever neutral 2 engage clutch 3 match rev 4 declutch 5 move gearshift lever next lower gear 6 engage clutch thi sound like lot work practice become natural problem doubleclutching solf normally function synchronizer within gearbox transmission without synchro worn synchro doubleclutching make much easier shift basically doubleclutch well using synchro thi generally unnecessary street car synchro good condition q number acceleration 060 14 mile skidpad slalom time auto magazine really mean may compared short 1 much magazine want believe 2 almost never detail acceleration number 060mph 14 mile time u may vaguely compared long come source testing procedure vary much magazine magazine comparing road track number car driver number quite pointles keep mind variation apply driver driver street driver major often major part equation skidpad vary even didnt skidpad figure really test stickines stock tire change radically tire compound change make assumption comparative handling say two sport sedan based skidpad number thi suggest skidpad without value however skidpad excellent educational tool driving school simply limited value comparison anything except tire slalom time slightly useful test small part automobile transient response however also heavily influenced stock rubber car test many corner car envelope tell need know making buying decision example dont tell rear end car road suddenly go offcamber car ha adjustable suspension test usually done sport setting may quite unsuitable daily driving list caveat could go page page q buddy claim wide tire dont make difference according hi freshman physic textbook cant ever accelerate corner 10g know talking 1 short hasnt got clue 2 detail equation friction used freshman physic textbook presume surface smooth dry nondeformable none properly apply tire traction except case stone cold tire dry pavement far proper operating temperature pavement never smooth alway irregular greater lesser extent tire really dry solid rubber substance natural form liquid ha coerced semblance solidity chemical magic deform match surface pavement vehicle traveling tire operating temperature grip actually generated shear stress inside deformed rubber anything even remotely resembling friction freshman physic sense term colder tire relative operating temperature closer behavimy traditional concept friction much hotter proper operating temperature likely possibility part tire actually reverting liquid mostly like happen deep tread causing characteristic blister chunking thi latter though almost completely unlikely happen normal street driving unles youre competition driver lot high speed track driving dont worry tire traction completely domain simple friction obey freshman physic equation thu dragster accelerate 10g race car corner brake 10g simple friction apply actually possible different sized contact patch generate differing amount grip actual analysi tire behavior would require technique finite element analysi due complexity mechanism misc question q name acronym stand list name commonly asked careful soliciting meaning name misinformation abound net particular never ask rechumor want useful result saab svenska aeroplan b swedish airplane corporation alfa societum anonima lombarda fabbrica automobili lombardy automobile manufacturing company fiat fabbrica italiana di automobili torino italian automobile manufacturer turin bmw bayerische motoren werke bavarian motor work mg morri garage q vw porsche porsche publicly held company controlled porsche piech family porsche ha extensive busines dealing vwaudi cause confusion since currently porsche financial difficulty possibility mercede vw may interested purchasing company near future thi speculation thi time richard welty 5183937228 weltycabotballtowncmacom nothing good ha ever reported full rotation race car either pitch roll axi carroll smith
