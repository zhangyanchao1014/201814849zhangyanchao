adaptec bb 24009600 408 9457727 please send comment correction etc vium email compuserve 752063074 internet darrylosrhpcom window 31 enhanced mode window 31 install program automatically configure window use adaptec 1542 however case something went wrong im going describe change needed get window 31 working 1542 also may noticed installing window 31 make ymy pc run much slower even youre running window method speeding discussed section called window 31 run slowly msdo configuration window install program add smartdrive disk cache ymy configsy autoexecbat file follow instruction youll notice youll need use doublebuffering smartdrive thi default setup youll also notice ymy system run much much slower window msdo see section called window 31 run slowly way speeding ymy system window configuration get adaptec 1542 work window make sure 388enh section systemini file contain entry virtualhdirqoff believe window install program automatically add thi entry systemini im sure thi doesnt work might want try adding line virtualhdirqoff systemrombreakpointfalse emmexcludea000cfff probably dont need line though systemrombreakpoint entry used enable support memory manager like qemm386max needed use program window 31 run slowly get window 31 running 1542 chance ymy system running much slower probably 1 happen using aspi4dossy version 31 ymy configsy file congratulation thi appear winning solution 2 lucky whether ymy luck hold remain seen ymy system running much slower thi almost definitely caused smartdrive doublebuffering according window documentation microsoft technical note q81808 smartdrive double buffering required aspi4dossy must use smartdrive doublebuffering enabled thi work really slow ymy pc estimated thi slowed pc factor 5 five consider thi unacceptable looked solution unfortunately disable doublebuffering window 31 enhanced mode work might even destroy content ymy hard disk trying run window 31 one following 1 use driver provide doublebuffering opinion unbelievable slownes smartdrive caused either horribly inefficient doublebuffering bug smartdrive 2 use driver provide vd service vd stand virtual dma service thi standard supported window 31 allows busmastering disk controller like 1542 work window trashing hard disk countles time found following solution none require using smartdrive note however getting occasional parity error probably caused solution might see following require smartdrive using kind disk cache utility strongly recommended thi make window run much much faster 1 aspi4dossy driver need aspus function controlling cdrom tape drive two physical hard disk etc add scsihasy driver ymy configsy file eg drivercscsihasy v386 window need v386 option thi driver must loaded low memory loaded high memory occupy 1620k november 1992 scsihasy driver could obtained adaptec bb 4089457727 hopefully still 2 need aspus function aspi4dossy driver version 30 30a use aspi4dossy scsihasy driver ymy configsy file eg drivercaspi4dossy drivercscsihasy v386 amazingly enough scsihasy driver also loaded high assuming 50 would thought thi would crash system doesnt asked adaptec technical support thi said loading scsihasy high fine long aspi4dossy loaded low system using scsihasy aspi4do 30a would occasionally cause window 31 crash upon restarting exiting window additional result corrupted disk cwindowsgrp file would corrupted crash usually occurred making different program progmanexe default window shell viceversa thi reason scsihasy may necessary absolutely idea scsihasy necessary version aspi4do earlier 30 note many person use aspi4do 30 30a without scsihasy seem problem consider person lucky like sort problem 3 opinion best necessarily easiest solution upgrade aspi4do 31 scsihasy driver longer needed unfortunately could get previou aspi4do upgrade adaptec bb aspi4do 31 driver available adaptec bb far know three way get copy buy new november 1992 adaptec ez scsi driver kit supposedly include aspi4do 31 well driver cdrom driver believe list price around 75 already copy older version aspi4do supposedly contact adaptec upgrade ez scsi around 30 copy aspi4do 31 included central point pc tool 80 msdo note documentation driver stored different directory note aspi4do included cdrom driver driver support two hard disk included thi obtained copy aspi4do 31 note however getting occasional parity error window probability defective hardware pc causing thi upgraded motherboard found solution however parity error occur disk access small definite possibility parity error driverrelated example changing bu onoff timing certain disk transfer might cause thi ive run variou memory test hour time test found problem thi problem probably caused memory marginal timing requirement cause parity error disk transfer thi memory test didnt find problem problem show disk io however im mentioning thi case isnt hardware problem floppycontrollerbased tape backup device two possible problem using adaptec 1542 floppycontrollerbased tape backup device colorado memory system jumbo 250 1 tape backupsrestore take long time tape drive constantly start stop start stop etc 2 tape operation may erratic encounter many tape error thi problem might caused defective hardware 1542 however ive heard person similar problem im mentioning thi case hardware problem 1542 tape backupsrestore take long time floppycontrollerbased tape backup device may adjust adaptec 15401542 bu onoff timing best result using tape drive normally tape backup restore tape drive motor continuously running occasional pause however default bu timing adaptec 15401542 may cause tape drive motor start stop start stop every second thi cause needle wear tape tape drive however note dirty tape head defective tape drive also cause thi make sure ymy tape head clean thi also cause tape backup restore take much much longer necessary problem tape backup use floppy dma transfer datum memory tofrom tape drive adaptec use dma transfer datum memory tofrom hard disk floppy dma need feed datum tape drive certain rate tape drive fed datum quickly enough floppy dma tape drive stop rewind bit restart enough datum eventually fed default bu timing adaptec really dma timing large example backup done datum ha transferred hard disk memory memory tape default timing adaptec hog memory much much time spent transferring datum hard disk memory enough time spent transferring datum memory tape drive result tape drive constantly start stop datum fed quickly enough solution change adaptec bu onoff timing default factory setting 11 microsecond 5 microsecond bu timing need lowered 24 microsecond thi done one two way aspi4do use n option example use bu timing 4 microsecond mean use following line configsy file devicecaspi4dossy n4 note space n 4 dont aspi4do ymy recourse try find program called setscsiexe difficult find reason adaptec reason seem want thi widely distributed asked someone worked adaptec asked upload anywhere anonymou ftp acces internet could try using archie hunt copy believe couple site find copy run like setscsi n4 thi adjust bu timing 4 microsecond running setscsiexe without argument reset bu timing back factory default note seem use setscsiexe use aspi4do setscsiexe crashed system aspi4do wa loaded could use setscsiexe scsihasy however lower bu timing 2 microsecond increase 11 microsecond lower low hard disk throughput suddenly drop ymy system feel slower 4 microsecond work fine thi value may work fine may adjust downward little youve lowered bu timing tape backup restore run faster also experiment bu onoff time option intentionally described unles know bad combination cause parity error worse starving memory refresh program called bustifixexe exist adaptec bb unles thi ha upgraded since last checked ha thi selfextracting archive containing batch file couple file thi batch file wa supposed allow one set bu onoff time 15401542 however tried running thi program 1542a system crashed time wa running scsihasy didnt check see wa conflict maybe thi old program work 1542b although doc say work 1542a erratic tape operation many tape error thi problem may may exist although existed system hardware problem particular 1542 could cause however ive heard person similar problem im mentioning thi case isnt hardware problem 1542 symptom thi problem persist even cleaning tape head 1 backing tape encounter unusable sector detected error resulting aborted tape backup 2 tape backup work tape compare fail 3 tape drive start stop start stop etc much often unlike abovementioned problem tape backupsrestore take long time tape drive start stop every second thi kind startingstopping occur every 1020 second 4 fastback plu 31 findsee tape backup device program like central point backup cm jumbo software assuming cm jumbo 250 tape drive findsee tape drive fastback plu 31 5 many tape read error although know causing thi problem discovered using different floppy controller solf month ago upgraded motherboard contained integrated floppy controller already floppy controller 1542 initially disabled motherboard floppy controller decided try disabling 1542 floppy controller using one motherboard thi tape drive cm jumbo 250 reliability increased dramatically fastback plu 31 wa suddenly able find use tape drive dont know thi wa caused hardware problem 1542 one hand floppy drife worked great attached 1542 seem say wa nothing wrong 1542 hand tape drive didnt work well attached 1542 floppy controller work attached different controller thi could indication hardware problem 1542 change floppy drive cable conceivable problem wa cable dont know cause really however youre similar problem might want consider trying new floppy controller sound card many popular sound card play record digitized sound thi typically done using dma like tape drive dma adaptec dma conflict sound card dma unlike tape dma thi conflict usually manifest parity error ymy system crash parity error message happen datum transferred quickly sound card adaptec memory refresh occur quickly enough cause parity error usually getting parity error mean hardware problem ymy system thi case however parity error symptom bad hardware ive found parity error typically occur recording digitized sound chance error increase increase recording fidelity eg higher sampling rate recording stereo recording using 16bit instead 8 etc like tape drive solution solution lower adaptec bu timing see section tape drife information thi done note however thi may may solve problem may reduce probability parity error software used record digitized sound greatly affect thi problem ie software inefficient disk cach speed ymy hard disk amount disk fragmentation also affect thi miscellaneou info thi section contain miscellaneou hint tip rumor much merely information ive heard read verified believe following information correct im sure use ymy risk qemm 600 601 602 need specify db parameter eg db2 unles using aspi4do driver dont qemm crashhang bootup although qemm manual mention thi install program seem detect 1542 present automatically add thi option qemm command line least thi occurred qemm 600 install program havent tested version earlier version qemm probably need thi parameter im sure ive never used version earlier 600 use aspi4do need give qemm db parameter version 1542 support hard disk one gigabyte size support hard disk capacity 1gb need get new rom bio adaptec im sure thi still true latest 1542b sold adaptec connect cdrom drive 1542 need scsi cdrom drive driver note cdrom drife proprietary interface nonscsi drife used 1542 three choice cdrom driver idea well following solution work even work following secondhand information 1 buy adaptec ez scsi driver package list something like 75 already older adaptec driver supposedly upgrade ez scsi around 30 contact adaptec detail ez scsi package supposedly contain everything need 2 buy corelscsi driver package made person make coreldraw thi package contain cdrom driver scsi tape driver worm driver etc know list price ive seen thi package sold around 8090 note corelscsi come aspi4do driver needed already aspi4do may better getting adaptec ez scsi instead 3 thi method obsolete following driver obsoleted adaptec ez scsi kit im mentioning case someone already ha driver use driver adaptec asw1410 kit aspi4do asw410 kit aspus cdrom driver get copy mscdexexe highlevel cdrom driver included asw410 kit thi available several bulletin board use scsi tape drive 1542 need software know talk scsi tape drive software ive
