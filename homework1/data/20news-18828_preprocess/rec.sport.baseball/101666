subject eck v rickey wa rickey whining smithmsukyedu brian smith article 6998bluecispittedu geneticpittedu david tate write ive read followup thi thought id go back original article make specific comment method jaomegatestcom john oswalt said ha obtained play play record computer readable form every major league baseball game past several year devised algorithm call sumoversituation wrote computer program calculate every major league player contribution using work like thi look every situation every game baseball season situation determined inning score baserunner many situation count many time team eventually game situation occured divide number time situation came come value situation thi wa first done george lindsey late 50searly 60 reported article investigation strategy baseball author george r lindsey journal operation research issue volume 11 4 julyaugust 1963 pp 477501 later pete palmer thing using simulated season generate larger set datum avoid kind smallsample anomaly person worried reported thi thehiddengameofbaseball john thorn gary skoog modified method bit work called value added measure based situational value hi based directly marginal run though win probability result applied 198 season reported one bill jame baseball abstract book 1987 help somebody example situation might inning 3 score 20 runner second 4212 regular season major league game last year rocky marlin thi year say thi situation came 100 team ahead 75 value thi situation 075 description method look change win probability based bat plu baserunning creditdebit player amount time get plate appearance player sum hi atbat baserunning value season obtain overall value player obviously sum player value game season whole 0 alway credit x batter x pitcher validation involved ok big problem nobody ha yet commented youre adding probability probability dont add run add total team run break many run joe contributed plu many run fred contributed etc probability dont work way bob increase hi team chance winning 1 400 pa mean bob increased hi team chance winning 400 fact doesnt mean anything unit screwy agree disagree john saying batter effort result 4 win loss probably correct 400 mean 4 win loss mean something would rather player increased team chance winning 1 400 pa would player increased chance winning 5 400 pa thu appear obviou positive association john statistic winning game thu disregard thi stat appear study must go sort relationship consider example bob hit 2out solo hr bottom first 12 ymy scale thing fourth score tied another 14 seventh score tied another 22 finally ninth win game score 76 value 05 bob hit 4 solo hr 4 plate appearance wa credited ymy method 12 14 22 5 98 mean wa bob 98 responsible win certainly defense alway 50 responsible include pitching bob wasnt pitching fact bob wa 47 offense lot even close 100 furthermore 3 team run say came solo hr fred fred wa hitting hr tie game valuable hr take lead see lindsey fred accrued good 4 rating fred bob combined amassed 138 win one game clearly problem problem insistance number mean exactly many win team ha first using average many season applying one game second remember player performance take away chance winning player get get negative probability case thu im sure given game add number team add 1 game sometime add one sometime le one also pitcher bad performance giving 6 run may given large negative percentage game also batter pulled 04 night would give large negative greg thinking right thing hi intuition mark closer enormously important total number run value outweighed come prevented comming doubling greg allows enough another article proposed test thi predict team wonlost record quite accurately looking many run total score allow without regard run score game late run really important early run looking late run lead better predictor right really smaller sample size would think however number run score first inning would good prediction many run score last inning realize something else closer usually come close situation blow hard argue run closer gife game equal importance given first inning look closer giving run often mean team lose many game hand starter gife run often still leaf hi team chance win offence ha many something saying late inning situation equally important either 8 run ninth really matter many run pitcher gife ninth another thought experiment apply thi method basketball find point scored first half game almost exactly value lead safe entire half yet play furthermore sub bench sink winning free throw time clock get 10 game star forward scored 27 point first half spraining hi ankle get zero thi make sense would assume team probability winning would 0 possesion free throw made look 1 point 5 second left fairly high probability win game possesion ball forget somebody else missed shot turnover foul bad defense etc caused negative chance team would win reading discussion thi statistic feel critisize certain extent agenda first look thi statistic valadate clutchnes really cluthnes revolf around idea certain player crucial situation elevate performance performance go ive never seen convincing proof thi really happen assume clutchnes mean except lot noice thi statistic ha positive association player performance way get rid noice believe clutchnes certainly could find average value home run example may find instance home run increase ymy chance winning 15 average strikeout decrease ymy chance winning 5 bet thi done would find thi statistic wa good statistic predicting win loss evaluate relief pitcher say john sam exact pitching statistic run earned run k bb etc exceptional number john however pitched closer situation sam wa mop man wa valuble team probably john wa better pitcher probably brian smith
