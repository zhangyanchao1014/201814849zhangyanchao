dating back 1950 stated person develop contained nonlethal nonseriou aspergillus infestation aspergiliosi sinuse leading sinu inflammation symptom ill dig reference since relevant thi discussion person really develop bad inflammatory proces mucu membrane skin bloom site whether thi allergic like reaction candida isnt certain doctor tested believe rast rast similar test allergic response specificially candida albican showed strong positive another question would everybody show strong positive thi test essentially useles assuming true candida grow partway mucu membrane tissue concentration exceed threshold amount could person test allergy candida definitely develop allergic symptom mucu membrane irritation due body allergic response said earlier post one need rocket scientist md degree phd biochemistry see plausibility thi hypothesi btw ill repost thi dr ivker hi book sinu survival ha routinely given anything else nizoral presporanox systemic antifungal safe good sporanox hi new chronic sinusitis patient antibiotic fmy time last two year claim 2000 patient well 90 notice relief sinu inflammation symptom doesnt cure mean implying socalled yeastfungu infection

diagnose even recognize disease know realize virtually impossible test candida overbloom part body easily observed since candida everywhere body real catch22 another catch22 totally reject yeast hypothesi say study done actually study done certain standard perspective nonstudy even considered agree appropriate study done take big right however order convince funding agency austere time open wallet literally give evidence acceptable evidence compete proposal paradoxically almost exact study needed funding 90 study even get funding scientist national lab im aware thi smaller funded project im afraid even dr ivker 100 doctor got together pooled practice case history anecdote compelling picture approach funding agency would get nowhere even able publish statistical result obviou comment doctor decided excessive yeast colonization gut sinuse leading noticeable nonlethal symptom exist even tenable hypothesi amount case history compiled anecdotal evidence contrary never change mind

quack ive said private email flaw current medical system make difficult even impossible physician attempt alternative therapy approvedprovenaccepted therapy dont work example went three ent said live acutechronic sinusitis ab failed mention surgery open ostium ostium werent plugged would get root cause condition three month aggressive fairly nonstandard therapy sporanox body nutrient level monitoring equalization vitamin c lentinen echinacea etc health ha vastly improved wa two year ago health greatly deteriorated course skeptic would say maybe nothing would improved anyway view stretching thing quite far experience three ent saw said id live im confident reach one could call total cure antifungal program undertook wa one necessary step direction overuse ab last fmy year note sinu problem may suggest book dr ivker mention sure get revised edition often wondered md chronic gi distres sinu problem would problem tell hi patient nonexistent syndrome dr ivker started chronic severe sinu problem hi visit several ent totally floored said youll live spent several year trying everything standard nonstandard wa essentially cured chronic sinusitis share hi approach hi book honestly say road recovery following part hi one recommendation take systemic antifungal beginning treatment history antibiotic overuse ha proven time time hi practice im sure commented hardcore belief antus yeast hypothesi poster would definite thing say worked wonder almost two thousand case put mildly also would surprised would say one violating moral obligation help patient maybe doctor reading thi practice confronted patient symptom could due hypothetical yeast overgrowth eg fit profile proyeast person identified consider antifungal therapy avenue exhausted remember theory practice two different thing one without synergistic doctor something nonstandard yet produce noticeable symptomatic relief thousand hi patient shouldnt least sit take notice maybe ought trust say begin hypothesizing work instead shouldnt work im afraid lot doctor become enamored scientific correctnes ignoring patient sworn help balanced dont see poster thi group come point use little common sense maybe empirical approach trying good systemic antifungal sporanox exhausted avenue wa one traditional medical establishment wa able help natural thing went couple doctor somewhat outside thi establishment result found significant relief would better traditional medical establishment set kind mechanism doctor without fear sued hi license pulled try experimental unproven beyond doubt therapy hisher patient finally reach point accepted therapy ineffective id like hear doctor tell well ive tried therapy approved accepted thi country since clearly dont work authority use experimental unproven technique seem helped cant promise anything risk sign something saying understand experimental possibly risky nature unproven therapy ill register ymy case state board anyway ent suggested thi wouldve jumped thi pronto instead going one doctor either altruistic reason greed practicing alternative therapy much risk himher risk meaning losing license possibly patient mechanism would keep control mainstream medicine also provide valuable datum would essentially free also would morally ethically better current system showing compassion medical community patient everything within reason help patient lack mechanism leading large number person try alternative therapy seem work like case never work true quackery better get soapbox thi post reach 500k size taken orally also become major bacterium gut aresol spray ha also used innoculate sinu membrane thi innoculation occur mucu membrane barrier system need strengthened thi accomplished vitamin vitamin c bcomplex vitamin diet survey repeatedly show american getting enough b6 folate probably segement population greatest problem thi nonexistent disordercandida bloom antibiotic therapy dosage b6 appear necessary promote healing
