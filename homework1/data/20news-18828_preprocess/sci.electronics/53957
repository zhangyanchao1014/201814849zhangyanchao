acollinsuclinkberkeleyedu andy collin subject voltage regulation current limiting one notsoquick question throw guy clas project need design build power supply following spec voltatge adjustable 112v current limited 1a voltage must stay within 2 designated value 01a ac ripple le 5 mv rm course cant use adjustable voltage currentlimiting regulator chip problem current limiting ie weve found stuff rest part circuit supply must presented load would draw 1a given supply voltage reduce voltage current equal one amp thu short thing ammeter read one amp measure current 1 ohm resistor 12v read one amp output voltage necessity must 1v basic idea seen current limiter involf circuit pull current base output power transistor therefore reduce output anybody idea could work thank advance andy collin kc6yey acollinsuclinkberkeleyedu p anybody want flame thi stupid project agree fully still graded
