schmidtauvax1adelphiedu subject grounding power wiring wa question 120vac outlet wiring ha quite bit discussion house wiring grounding practice point need clarified equipment grounding conductor green green yellow stripe bare metal sheath pipe wiring method used safety ground carry fault current back circuit breaker panel limit voltage metal case utilization equipment metal object never except exception discussed later carry normal operating current connected load equipment ha filter power supply may cause slight current flow grounding conductor much communication audio equipment sensitive noise slight voltage grounding conductor may require special wiring grounding conductor provide reliable operation orange outlet often used thi insulated grounding conductor wired back panel box many case back service anyone installing system read section grounding national electric code publication installing quiet isolated ground system code require insulated grounding conductor green wire run current carrying conductor back panel box required back way service entrance bonded service ground water pipe rod many system installed illegally unsafely provide safe ground quiet ground either grounded conductor circuit often called neutral referred code identified conductor supposed white natural grey thi conductor supposed connected ground electrical system single point generally service entrance panel thi connection main bonding jumper many household service panel main bonding jumper actually bonding screw attach neutral busbar case panel grounded conductor neutral generally current carrying conductor case 120 volt circuit one two conductor completing circuit panel load device since grounded conductor neutral connected grounding conductor bare green service entrance load distance service draw significant current small measurable voltage grounded grounding conductor load normal operating condition incorrectly connect grounded neutral conductor grounding conductor load neutral current flow instead grounding conductor since current flowing grounding conductor also longer quite ground potential load end load equipment ha metal case connected grounding conductor u ground plug metal case also longer quite ground potential difference normal non shortcircuit condition may tenth volt could also volt two thi normally present shock hazard however let metal case grounded equipment come contact independently grounded object water ga pipe radiator metal air conditioning duct part neutral current try flow thi aalternate ground path contact solid get significant arc low voltage possibly moderate current arc wrong condition thi arcing could start fire possible case sneak ground current could also flow wire inadequate size causing overheat incorrect non singlepoint grounding neutral short circuit hot neutral high short circuit current may flow cause much higher voltage grounding conductor increase possibility shock fire also incorrectly multiply connect neutral ground voltage ground system seen noise bu computer audio equipment often causing malfunction spent hour tracking short technical facility inducing severe hum equipment neutral usually bonded ground distribution transformer well service entrance dwelling thi done primarily lightning protection induced lightning current short path back ground also assure current drawn short grounded object like pipe draw enough current trip circuit breaker blow fuse quickly bad side thi neutral current dwelling go neutral wire back transformer flow grounding electrode water pipe etc thi may cause corrosion pipe possibly thing like underground fuel oil tank may also cause measurable ac magnetic field due large loop hot conductor service neutral current water pipe ground feel field may unhealthy dont flame thi im telling field come health effect far im concerned jury still thi note bonding jumper installed main panel sub distribution panel thi one reason illegal run service entrance cable sheath used neutral sub panel must seperate insulated conductor neutral sheath used thi application grounding conductor neutral bonded grounding conductor sub panel say forgetting remove bonding screw grounding conductor load panel ground possible problem listed code make exception range dryer well feed one building another case range dryer neutral may used equipment ground certain condition instead seperate wire every time code revised exception come review exception fact first required safety ground day u ground outlet appliance manufacturer dont want redesign range drier contractor dont want run fmy wire cable fmy fairly heavy expensive wire place three wire appliance question would safer seperate neutral stove neutral current low burner setting since current 220 volt hot except low setting wire large gauge reported case injury damage far exception survived case feed building primarily lightning protection person wiring aware isnt legal grounding conductor obviously bare wire romex ground anywhere green wire installed portable cord good grounding conductor sheath bx clamped bx connector metal box legal grounding conductor u bx ha aluminum band run steel sheath lower resistance sheath cut thi aluminum band end dont bond anything job touching every turn bx sheath conduit emt thinwall tubing generally legal grounding conductor may require bonding locknut enter box panel particularly larger pipe greenfield look like big bx pull ymy wire empty sheath run legal grounding conductor doesnt aluminum band bond spiral steel ha much resistance inductance run seperate green grounding conductor inside greenfield wiremold also legal grounding conductor paint box often prevent good contact feed wiremold extension often box wall may well connected first wiremold box personally discovered case entire run wiremold case everything plugged outlet run hot 120 volt get shock every time touch computer radiator office wa ground wire wiremold one outlet shorted edge wiremold box must run ground wire back wiremold outlet least first box original wiring conduit bx etc bond wire box screw bnding clip whatever another issue ground green wirelug gcfi outlet ever place ground legal nec use without ground ground available better protection ground fault interrupter protection dont install interrupter doesnt depend ground trip desirable connect ground available ground connected interrupter trip soon faulty device plugged wherea without ground trip someone something provide ground path questioning legal use ungrounded gcfi read nec 2107 exception thi 1990 code 93 code city know rule hasnt changed might renumbered though touched surface concerning grounding much thi subject fallen asleep john john h schmidt pe internet schmidtauvax1adelphiedu technical director
