without outlet lamp junction box great number wire going wiring pas closet instead wall ceiling backwrapped grounding wire subject thi weird stuff old style wiring year since edison invented electricity several different wiring style come gone buy older home may encounter thi stuff thi section describe old method idiosyncrasy oldest wiring system youre likely encounter called knob tube kt made individual conductor cloth insulation wire run along side structural member eg joist stud using ceramic standoff knob wire run structural member using ceramic tube connection made twisting wire together soldering wrapping tape since hot neutral run separately wiring tend rather confusing neutral often run centre room tap fixture hot wire tended run one fixture next case kt isnt colourcoded neutral often colmy hot wire youll see kt home built late 40 comment kt person installing kt pretty paranoid electricity workmanship tend pretty good wire insulation insulator tend stand well kt ive seen example quite good condition grounding grounding usually difficult install box small receptacle replacement particularly gfcus difficult bushing box either wiring change need special attention box entry sometime neutral isnt balanced well separately hot circuit sometime possible overload neutral without exceeding fusing circuit building code permit insulation wall contain kt connection existing kt new circuit tricky consult ymy inspector modern wiring practise require considerably outlet installed kt system since kt tend pretty decent condition generally isnt necessary replace simply kt watch renovation interfered cautiou circuit loading many case perfectly reasonable leave existing kt alone add new fixture new circuit using modern technique kt invented multiconductor cable first type see roughly cloth varnish insulation look much like romex cable last decade two thi stuff wa used 40 50 grounding conductor wa installed much like modern wiring major drawback thi type insulation embrittle weve seen whole system insulation would fracture fall touch bx cable vintage ha similar problem thi stuff fragile become rather hazardou wire become bare thi wiring left untouched much possible whenever opportunity arise replace simple receptacle switch replacement turn several hmy long frustrating fight electrical tape heatshrink tubing thi wiring technique modern romex wa invented almost asphalt impregnated cloth often bit sticky thi stuff stand reasonably well doesnt present hazard reasonably easy work need replaced considered safe modern stuff thermoplastic insulation wire dont abuse much subject buy stuff try find proper electrical supply outlet near price often considerably better chain hardware store diy centre better quality material wider variety
