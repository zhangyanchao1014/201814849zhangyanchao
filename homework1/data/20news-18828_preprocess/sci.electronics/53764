kubovichiastateedu mark w kubovich subject commonmode noise small signal never worked really small signal question low level noise noticed waveform synthesizer using analogic 2020 ha relatively large common mode noise using thi synthesizer null another transient waveform amplifying difference 200uv several hundred time 2020 ha 13 mvpp common mode noise thi tend make measurement hard repeat noise quite sync line frequency spectrum analyzer main component 64hz get rid noise look spectrum using hp 3582a audio range analyzer noise go away minute switch isolation input guessing anlayzer ha diff amp input since read accurately dc also use differential amplifier ia solve problem important use one shield driver amp connected shield sort feedback loop remove trouble caused different cable capacitance anyone suggest good ic ia use transient signal content 1khz 300khz would appreciate
