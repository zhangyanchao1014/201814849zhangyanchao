wellisonkuhubccukansedu subject help ultralong timing thank respose good idea looking using couple idea recieved mail today spec sheet mil spec version exar xr2240 timercounter chip stable 50 c suck little power show application ultralong time delay several year depending rc time constant thi application two cascaded together reset trigger pin chip tied together timebase second chip disabled thi configuration output high system reset triggered output go low stay way total 65536 x timing cycle first chip total timing cycle two chip programmed 256 x r x c 65536 x r x c 256 step selecting combination counter output timer output beauty timebase chip would 100uf timing cap 391k resistor 391 second per timing cycle get maximum 25624576 second timing cycle 391 x 65536 29 day course much need 14 day counter allows 256 binary step selected output pellet puker first 14 day trip would reset self next 14 day timing cycle forth power still problem though idea suggested wa bury electronic hole dug snow insulator put pellet puker tower estimated snow fall solar panel keep charge lithium battery pack like idea thi thing ha work least six week three sample ga valf 12 volt spit pellet onto snow anyway ordered xr2240 see interesting long im one ha go digging pellet middle antartica freezing bun thank everyone
