scst83csclivacuk mr cd smith subject voltage multiplier problem hi ive built valve preamp use diodecapacitor voltage multiplier step 12vac supply voltage approx 260vdv load resistance increase rc constant decrease hence output voltage drop need high output voltage possible 260v circuit consist seven voltage multiplier stage ie 14 diode 14 capacitor capacitor develop 38v acros take output acros seven capacitors260v capacitor 100mfd 68v increase capacitor rating 220470mfd increase rc constant hence alleviate problem capacitor going little expensive need 14 1 would happen connected 470mfd 400v capacitor parallel output hence parallel seven 100mfd capacitor assume increase c circuit hence increase rc time constant output voltage become stable thi killed two bird one stone experiencing 50hz ripple hence amp hum thi new capacitor smooth thi 2 anyone recomend suitable value inductor choke placed output line power supply filter 50hz main hum lowest resistance possible ive got preamp moment much distraction im university ive got get dissertation finished two week hence im mailing playing solderoing iron itll cheaper long run especially 14 new large capacitor dont work planned email please cant alway read net thank advance chri name mr chri smith twang ole guitar addr scst83ukaclivcsc uni liverpool university quest build hardware dgree computer science ever sun may certainly ball flaming ga dh lawrence view expressed reflect private thought
