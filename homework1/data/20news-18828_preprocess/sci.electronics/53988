idhnessiemccacuk ian hawkin subject making odd resistor value required filter constructing active filter odd value resistor often required ie something like 314 k ohm resistorit seem best choose common capacitor value cope strange resistance demanded pd program work best make resistance given fixed resistor standard 12 value per decade1 1215182233 etc common enough problem yet cant recall seing program tell rxryrz gife rq starting q finding prefered value xy z cheer ian h
