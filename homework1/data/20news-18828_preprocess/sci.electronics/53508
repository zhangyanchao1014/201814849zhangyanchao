dgj2ykelvinseasvirginiaedu david glen jacobowitz subject dumb question function generator new scope thought id save buck buying one function generator built awhile noticed two thing function generator one seem bia even pulloffset pushed pull know adjust get signal san random 50mv bia really annoying thing damn output wont go 1v pp student may guessed previou post often measure input impedance variou circuit buildmany circuit maximum input signal way le 500mv amplitude input impedance 10 kohm range thing order use function generator divide voltage thing reasonable course measurethe input impedance circuit going throw another resistor series 50ohm output generator could ignore thi little divider figure kind pain way could make little box could solve thi little problem box would tka function generator input lower voltage give output impedance low unchanging number would want lower voltage factor one hundred could build little buffer amp id like thi box active quick idea scope broken reason sent shop get repaired replaced function generator wa way one please help feeling stupid today dave dgj2yvirginiaedu
