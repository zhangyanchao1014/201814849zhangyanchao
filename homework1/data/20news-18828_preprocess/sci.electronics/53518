kolstadcaewiscedu joel kolstad subject dumb question function generator article c5j8453b8murdochaccvirginiaedu dgj2ykelvinseasvirginiaedu david glen jacobowitz write new scope thought id save buck buying one function generator built hmm wa ad combination radiohand cranked generatorflashlightsiren saw function generator ha 50mv offset amplitude high way could make little box could solve thi little problem box would tka function generator input lower voltage give output impedance low unchanging number would want lower voltage factor one hundred could build little buffer amp id like thi box active sure youve already got right idea ignoring 50 ohm internal resistance generator second run say voltage divider made 990 ohm series 10 ohm thi new circuit thevenin equivalent one put 1100 original voltage ha output impedence negligibly le 10 ohm may want monkey value little depending whether care exact dividing ratio availability part sound joel kolstad p thi 10001 high voltage probe multimeter accurate still cheap something like 100 meg series 100k doesnt load often high impedence source much well keeping probably 10 meg impedance multimeter happy
