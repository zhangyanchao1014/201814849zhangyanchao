tombhplslahpcom tom bruhn subject analog system need ground plane engp2254nusunix1nussg soh kam yung write understand need ground plane digital system however would like know ground plane also necessary analog system note thi ground plane connected except one point signal ground keep getting conflicting answer thi ground plane analog system help reduce noise also system deal low frequency signal 100hz well one reason getting conflicting answer depend want ground plane continuou conductor good electrostatic shield signal ymy board need shielding rom thing thi shielding wont much good magnetic field unles make continuou around circuit shielded like faraday cage flip side coin working high impedance could end capacitance gound plane cause problem arent likely encounter thi 100hz 20khz real problem one bit
