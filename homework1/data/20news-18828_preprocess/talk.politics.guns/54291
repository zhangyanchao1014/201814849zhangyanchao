message garbage collecting done think trying tell something vikingiastateedu dan sorenson write thank great change tired old debate lurker join time know ahhh talkpoliticsgun kindler gentler newsgroup would thought exactly reason thi sort restriction possible endangerment poorly maintained rifle dangerou user since doesnt endanger justification restriction remind shrapnel consider 5 reasonable space limitation make mistake gun blowing hazard nearby say next lane range point wa distance level threat draw line endangerment 5 restriction possibility shot hence draw 15 mile restriction nuke draw 5 mile restriction al suffer fundamental flaw restrict based upon instrument rather placing responsibility usage squarely upon shoulder user perhap sen metzenbaum declaring barrett light fifty assault rifle ha made thi apparent since barrett ha range acurracy going determined life worth effort protect home family using nuclear weapon close home accomplish thi disagree ground house rebuilt much easily family died assume word would get citizen attack wa planned thi case tactical strategic implication change quite bit personally home worth say twenty martian intent taking world family balancing act hard judge sitting desk however another problem case civil war strength militia fighting side reflect popular public split 67 versu 33 minority militia 21 disadvantage need popular support would hopefully prevent insurrection unles person really behind rebel heavy weapon owned small fraction militium could distort thi 33 minority included tank artillery owner seem case already given heavy weapon arent commonly owned citizenry low number obviously due cost dont think superior weapon going great effect numerically superior foe furthermore even doubtful training include proper tactical movement best utilize tank wherea commonly rifleman hampered effectivenes think vital avoid situation small minority would reasonable chance gaining political power violence prevent thi may necessary give control heavy weapon eg small number individual would whose firepower would grossly distort relation popular support military strength someone individual militiaman thi certainly good thing think lesser two evil whoever control weapon must democratic body responsive person envisioned armorer perhap officer select group like would exercise control heavier complex weapon joe bob old sherman tank certainly wouldnt ask give follow order officer ye since expense tank large though chance would jointly purchased therefore jointly maintained operated think carefull state talking certainly one role militium overthrow repressive government would completely destructive end government control militia arm united state several level government able act independently likely target rebelion rebelion state local government unlikely think therefore state possibly local government could safely allowed keep select militia heavy weapon risk abuse still something consider far le similar risk federal government control thi ill agree point state control heavy weapon justification state centrally located keep spread ability state lock isnt easy otherwise would assume state control would rest authority governor militium officer eaxctly think removed select militium privide militia heavy weapon highlytrained specialist reason outline think heavy weapon tank artillery aircraft etc better kept local government small number individual however local government shouldnt able use select militium without support person ideally general militium direct control person select militium direction democratic local government would opperate together even worst case general militium able functional without select militium similarly select militium incapable action without aid general militium im hard time seeing heavy weapon fairly number could easily wielded person government support argued weapon divvied democratic control one side doesnt cant see thi situation alleviated select militium holding weapon unorganized militium infantry think better mix called would argue federal army rely upon select militium unorganized militium bulk infantry unit consider effect removing national guard infantry placing guard control local government governmentcontroled select militium could fight effectively without infantry support provided general militium inherently infantry organization hand general militium could function although disadvantage without backing local government select militium assume would would side governmentcontrolled force theyve equipment infantry force 3x size would trouble id like see heavy stuff say tank offset local troup 105 antitank weapon armory would much useful infantry tank would cost training requirement figured suppose im quibbling constitute heavy equipment mechanized infantry unit build dike time flood set disaster relief city like would much rather see thing handled local general militia would resource often arent available outfit local unit well enough thu certainly call mechanized unit carry stuff faster anything else perhap national guard isnt close conception select militium thought wa considering heavy weaponsarmor arm militium infantry arm regular army perhap idea heavy weapon different think main battle tank selfpropelled artillery 155mm field piece heavy stuff m113 troop carrier 2 12 ton truck humvee old m60 tank 105 howitzer stuff mechanized infantry actually thi guard unit iowa currently fielding unit perhap innate fear real heavy equipment state control little number light stuff act deterrent allowing main battle tank state balanced antitank capability local rank similarly local unit would need band together quickly hence small fast response mean mechanized infantry finally militium fighting equipment needed response federal army im convinced minumum infantry relying state local militia function dan sorenson dod 1066 z1danexnetiastateedu vikingiastateedu isu
