compressing either fullcolor grayscale digital image natural realworld scene work well nonrealistic image cartoon line drawing jpeg handle blackandwhite 1bitperpixel image handle motion picture compression standard compressing type image worked committee named jbig mpeg respectively jpeg lossy meaning image get decompression isnt quite identical originally put algorithm achieve much compression exploiting known limitation human eye notably fact small color detail arent perceived well small detail lightanddark thu jpeg intended compressing image looked human plan machineanalyze ymy image small error introduced jpeg may problem even invisible eye useful property jpeg degree lossines varied adjusting compression parameter thi mean image maker trade file size output image quality make extremely small file dont mind poor quality thi useful indexing image archive making thumbnail view icon etc etc conversely arent happy output quality default compression setting jack quality satisfied accept lesser compression 2 use jpeg two good reason make ymy image file smaller store 24bitperpixel color datum instead 8bitperpixel datum making image file smaller big win

thu using jpeg essentially timespace tradeoff give time order store transmit image cheaply worth noting network phone transmission involved time saving transferring shorter file much greater extra
