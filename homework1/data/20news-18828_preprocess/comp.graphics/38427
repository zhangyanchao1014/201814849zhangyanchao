stevehcrlgw steven collin subject sphere 4 point another method first find center circle defined 2 set 3 point intersecting normal thi would also define circle center however small numerical imprecision would make line intersect supposedly 3 plane intersect unique point parallel thought thi dont project 2 line onto 2d plane formed line intersection calculation plane 2d youre guaranteed unique solution unles theyre parallel wont happen thi case use parametric distance along line circle centre determine exact point interest thi bypass messy error propogation required calculation 3d hope havent put foot steve steven collin email stevecrlhitachicojp visiting computer graphic researcher phone 0423231111 hitachi central research lab tokyo fax 0423277742
