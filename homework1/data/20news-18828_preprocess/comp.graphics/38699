pinkytamuedu man behind curtain subject view isomorphic perspective im working upon game using isometric perspective similar used populou basically look room look similar following xxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx 2 xxxx 1 xxxx x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx xxxx x xxxx 3 xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx good thing thi perspective look move around three dimension still maintain ymy peripheral vision since ymy viewpoint alway routine hardcoded particular vantage case wall two rising edge ha slope 14 im also using mode x 320x240 ive run two problem im sure reader tried thi perhap formulated opinion 1 routine drawing wall 1 2 trivial ran packedplanar image wa dismayed jaggy im considered antialiasing routine speed really necessary worth effort artist draw wall already skewed thu assured nice image thi much burden 2 wall 3 present problem algorithm used tend overly distort original tried decide paper pixel go failed ha anyone come method mapping planar crosswise sheared shape currently take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 produce 1 2 3 4 33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20 5 6 7 8 49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24 9 10 11 12 53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16 57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32 61 62 63 64 line 1 follow slope line 2 directly line 1 line 3 move line left 4 pixel line 4 line 3 thi fill shape exactly without unfilled pixel cause distortion ha anyone come better way perhap necessary simply draw original bitmap already skewed particularly sticky problem thi perspective wa planning hidden plane removal using zbuffering location stored xyz form noticed top line wall 2 wall 1 parallel bottom line thi appear optical illusion ie appear either inside outside cube depending ymy mood vanishing point thi simplify drawing code object dont change size move room ive decided thi approximation alright since small displacement large enough distance cause little change apparent size object real perspective drawing hopefully context picture ie chair floor torch hanging wall dispell visual ambiguity thank advance help till next time v v emailpinkytamuedu sam inala v
