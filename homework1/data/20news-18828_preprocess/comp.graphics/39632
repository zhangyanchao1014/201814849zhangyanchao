regular question gamma correction since go great pain deal properly xli image loader program maintain explanation often use answer question thi might suitable inclusion faq graeme gill note gamma correction image author graeme w gill graemelabtamozau date 93516 thi gamma stuff anyway although would nice think image image lot complication whole bunch different image format gif jpeg tiff etc etc whole lot technical stuff make dealing image bit complicated gamma one thing youve ever downloaded image bb net youve probably noticed image viewing program image look ok look dark look light thi may ask thi gamma correction lack need gamma correction gamma correction needed nature crt cathode ray tube monitor usually used viewing image sort real live scene turn computer image measuring amount light coming point scene created linear ungammacorrected image thi good thing many way manipulate image value image file light ie adding multiplying work like real light real world take image file turn pixel value voltage feed crt find crt doesnt give amount light proportional voltage amount light coming phosphor screen depend voltage something like thi lightout voltage crtgamma dump ymy nice linear image crt image look much dark fix thi gamma correct image first need opposite crt image thing cancel get want thi ymy image gammacorrectedimage image 1crtgamma crt crtgamma somewhere 10 30 seem complicated problem display program gamma correction also source image give linear image video camera video signal general thi lot image already gamma correction done rarely sure much try display one image program gamma correction image get corrected twice look way light display one image program doesnt gamma correction look vaguely right perfect gamma correction exactly right particular crt whose fault thi really three thing one display program dont gamma correction properly another image format dont specify standard gamma dont way recording gamma correction third thing many person understand gamma correction create lot image varying gamma least two file format right thing utah graphic toolkit rle format ha semistandard way recording gamma image jfif file standard use jpeg compression specify image encoded must gamma 10 ie linear image everyone obey rule image loader instance xli x11 image utility allow specify gamma monitor using individual gamma value image trying view image viewer eg xv another x11 image program utility eg pbm toolkit provide way changing gamma image figure overall gamma correction allowing undoing gamma correction image ha gamma correction need suite ymy crt monitor note xv 221 doesnt provide easy way modifying gamma image need adjust r g b curf appropriate gamma coledit control altering intensity hsv control doesnt right thing fail take account effect gamma ha h thi tend give tint image figure viewer gamma screen ha simplest way try loading file chkgammajpg provided xli distribution jfif jpeg format file containing two grayscale ramp ramp chosen look linear human eye one using continuou tone using dithering ymy viewer right thing gamma correct image two ramp look symmetrical point look equally bright almost exactly half way top bottom find thi point help move away little screen defocu ymy eye bit ymy viewer doesnt gamma correction left hand ramp long dark part short white part point equal brightnes center ymy viewer way setting right amount gamma correction display equal brightnes point center increase gamma decrease center value usually around 22 xli instance adjust display gamma dispgamma flag youve got right set displaygamma environment variable ymy profile figure gamma image thi tricky bit general rule seem lot true color ie 24 bit ppm jpg image gamma 10 linear although many gamma correction seem majority pseudo color image ie 8 bit image color map gif etc gamma corrected degree ymy viewer gamma correction linear image look good gamma corrected image look light ymy viewer doesnt gamma correction linear image look dark gamma corrected image ok linear image sometime good thing one reason many high quality format video use gamma correction actually make better use storage medium thi human eye ha logarithmic response light gamma correction ha similar compression characteristic thi mean image could make better use 8 bit per color instance used gamma correction implication though every time want image processing convert 8 bit image 12 linear bit retain accuracy since little popular software thi none popular image format agree standard gamma correction factor difficult justify gamma corrected image popular level image format standardize particular gamma image manipulation software take care use extra precision dealing linearized internal datum gamma corrected distribution image would good thing told kodak photocd format instance ha standard gamma correction factor enable get highest quality bit used hold image
