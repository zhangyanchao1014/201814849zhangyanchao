thi make sense main use xv viewing image many change image keep modification buffer making operation 24bit image simplify operation list unnecessary operation think saying 24 bit image quantised 8 bit many similar colour mapped onto single palette colmy thi colmy get modified fairly arbitrary way want apply modification back 24 bit file find colour mapped thi one palette colmy suppose dont know discussed discussed error xv 221 show image 8bit suggestion work perfectly look consistent first post something seem suggest see xv 8 bit program sort error post asy bug meant like post say bug never said wa misunderstood etc saying discussed error xv 221 show image 8bit would make ymy mind claiming would make discussion lot easier far seen colormap editing window xv must colormap anyway problem present exist anyway didnt tried solve would make problem program first place eh sorry dont understand saying aware english ymy native language tried hard fathom ymy meaning thi paragraph defeat gamma color correction easily done 24bit image presented need make trick 8bitquantized image back 24 bit image ye originally said global change easily possible thi statement contradict said earlier wrote something making color modification quickly 8bit quantized image saving image file proces make modification 24bit image would suggest colmy editing 24 bit file would group related colour edit together global change could done unles software different much complicated ok youre writing situation user want edit image 24bit user want edit individual color ymy question way jump discussion bit dont think actually talking loading 24 bit image xv quantising manipulating colour colmy editor somewhow applying change 24 bit file exit xv xv let edit individual colour thi sudden jumping topic solution doesnt work colormap withing real 24bit image ye aware colourmap 24 bit file see user see 24bit image going back 8bit silly understand thi statement supposed mean changing individual color 8bitquantizedrasterized image changing individual color colormap useles case image quantized rasterized small change may make seriou error anywhere image saying xv allows thi feature dont recommend use mentioned type image ah see thew problem first want extend xv allow editing 8 bit preview 24 bit image point problem thi saying problem personally happen use part program cause problem moreover xv paint program make global change sure saying certainly one make local change full 24bit xv changing individual color sound like paint program job person 8bit screen need trick get original 24bit image modified user dont see full 24bit image need make approximation possible modify individual color individual pixel pixel group image rasterized select indiavidual color could 7x7 cursor window show true color image cursor window area selecting individual color possible ye one possible approach would find program took approach clumsy however ok dont thought much 24bit painting program never seen good view planned make mention 24bit painting program 8bit screen well agree thought much dont seem consistent point make contradict one post next ok day perhap step back think thi one ye wa wrong xv saved 8bitquantizedrasterized image 24bit jpeg jpeg designed said last post jpeg compression algorithm way saving disk space trading quality compression fail see problem proposed workable alternative also human expect 24bit saved 24bit image speak person met spoken quantised 24 bit image 8 bit expect thi proces somehow reverse file saved keeping modificvation heve made 8 bit image palette perhap yused singular say person would like crop part image save expected image still look next time import 24 bit image xv look carefully main control panel tell many colour allocated 8 bit image xv make abundantly clear editing original 24 bit file person claim thi confusing xv designed without thinking human interface human expect program work design error design error bug read lip xv program viewing modifying 8 bit image let import image show would say good deal thought human interface everyone else seem use happily purpose wa designed make false claim heard xv designed first 8bit imagesfile good idea take full 24bit image without making major change original design would come solid logical well argued lucid description precisely proposed extension would work feel free post far done even screen image 8bit processed image saved image could 24bit easily instead 8bit argh thi comment like easily ok go ahead code easy alternatively look term import nonreversible transformation anybody make note ye may well make lift mean lift go mean lift go put note thi design solution manual however even manual tell correct situation doesnt solve problem american lift example think thi bit exageration actually saying got lift elevator state mistakenly pressed button go everyone else problem trying sue manufacturer well text may bit hard reading bet hopefully suggeeded read mostly leaving aside language issue however betray wooly thinking admit language go think chri lilley technical author ittus computer graphic visualisation training project computer graphic unit manchester
