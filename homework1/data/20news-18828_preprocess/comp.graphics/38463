rwscsarizonaedu ronald w schmidt subject outlining spline surface year ago started work problem appeared simple turned quite difficult wondering anyone net ha seen thi problem hopefully published solution problem draw outline surface defined two roughly parallel cubic spline input problem essentially start two set point set point edge object treat two dimensional ie extant edge exist three dimensional space draw object 1 fit cubic spline point spline effectively computed sequence line segment approximating curve spline ha equal number segment assume nth segment along spline roughly exactly distance along spline reasonable measure 2 take segment n along spline match nth segment opposing spline use pair segment form two triangle filled color surface 3 depth sort triangle 4 take triangle sorted order project onto 2d pixmap draw color triangle take edge triangle along edge surface draw line along edge colored special edge color edge coloring step 4 heart problem idea effectively outline edge surface net result however generally ha lot break gap edge surface reason thi fairly complicated involve rasterization problem problem resulting projecting spline anything thi problem sound familiar would appreciate knowing work thi area thank
